.BPEACE AND PREPARATION
.p
Each of the three kings had suffered a defeat in the great war. 
All three armies were greatly weakened and unable to execute a successful offensive against the others. 
There was nothing to do but rest and rebuild the armies for a final showdown. 
.p
Arthur had come out of the wars fairly well. 
His was the only kingdom that had not been ravaged, and his army had suffered minor losses. 
Thanks to his parsimonious military spending policy, he was now wealthier than any other king on the island. 
He could afford to raise his army to larger levels than any other king. 
Yet, he did not immediately expand his army to the largest size he could afford. 
Instead, he raised its size to only 35 men-at-arms. 
This was adequate to assure him of a reasonable defense against any attacker and yet still allowed his kingdom
enough revenues to grow. 
He raised the tithes from Hengist's kingdom and from Hoel's kingdom. 
They had enjoyed a long period of peace and had prospered under it; the increased tithes did not strain
them. 
With this increased income, he again raised the size of his army, this time to 40 men-at-arms. 
This was equal in size to both Hengist's and Uryens' armies. 
Arthur had at last achieved parity with his enemies. 
The crucial difference was that the other two kings were bankrupting their realms to maintain their armies;
Arthur's domain was still enjoying steady growth. 
Arthur could now rest assured of the final outcome of the conflict that would soon arise. 
The only way that they could stop him now was by banding together against him. 
.p
During the long period of waiting and building, two more knights, Bors and Tristran, joined the Round Table. 
Neither was a magnificent warrior in a class with Lucas, Gawain, or Galahad;
indeed, Bors was a rather poor warrior only slightly better than Mordred. 
Tristran was a moderately good fighter, and Arthur was certain that he could make good use of him. 
Tristran was obviously very pleased and happy to be a member of the Round Table; he doted on Lancelot and
pestered the other knights with questions about the battles they had fought. 
Bors seemed to have little interest in martial or material advancement. 
He had an eye for the ladies, especially the young serving girls who were easily impressed by a noble knight. 
He made quite a sensation at the court with his numerous dalliances. 
.p
The gossip about Bors did not concern the existence of his sexual escapades but their sheer quantity. 
The court at Camelot had never been known for any puritanical tendencies, and virginity was generally considered
a waystation between puberty and adulthood. 
But Bors' behavior surprised and titillated the court. 
What fascinated the men, and especially the ladies of Camelot, was Bors' ability to simultaneously carry on
a multitude of passionate affairs. 
How did he do it? 
His partners, if they were known and questioned, presented no explanation other than a distant smile. 
Even more exciting was the almost daily revelation, real or purported, of new trysts. 
Where, everyone wondered, would Bors strike next? 
The question was repeated with dismay by the men and anticipation by the women. 
.p
The matter exploded from gossip to crisis when Bedivere chanced upon Bors in the act of seducing one Verrine,
a lady whom Bedivere had once championed and still held most warmly. 
Swords were drawn and reinforcements quickly arrived from all over the castle. 
Arthur hurried in just in time to avert a full-scale civil war. 
He firmly reproached all the would-be combatants, and publicly ordered Bors to confine his amorous imperialism
to women outside Camelot. 
That settled the matter. 
.p
The months rolled by, with none of the kings willing to make a move. 
Arthur bided his time, secure in the knowledge that time was on his side. 
Still, he was beginning to wonder how he would break the stalemate. 
He dreaded the thought of a gigantic battle with the huge forces available to the three kings. 
It would surely be a bloody and melancholy affair. 
There had to be a less sanguineous solution. 
.l1
.i10
"Tell me, Merlin, is there any other way to conquer the kings of Britain without so much bloodshed?" 
,"A noble question, Arthur; I am glad to hear you ask it. 
Unfortunately, I must tell you that there is no way to achieve your goals now without battle. 
You did make matters more difficult by attacking your friend Pellinore. 
Penda's heart is hopelessly hardened against you. 
He will never accept you as his liegelord. 
Uryens is not so full of hate; he can be convinced to accept your claim to kingship." 
,"So I must fight Penda, then?" 
,"More: you must defeat and destroy him." 
,"Might Penda be willing to accept Uryens as his liege, with Uryens then becoming my vassal?" 
,"That is a clever idea; it could thwart much bloodshed, but Penda also hates Uryens deeply. 
It is unlikely that he would cooperate." 
,"So Penda must die." 
,"That is the only way." 
,"A war to the death will be very long and very, very difficult. 
I cannot simply kill Penda. 
He will stay inside his castle." 
,"No, he is so full of hate that he will come out to fight you if you pillage his land. 
But as soon as the battle turns against him, and his royal guard is destroyed, he will retreat to his castle
again. 
,"Is there no way to kill him, then? 
Have you not some magic that will do the job for me?" 
,"No, I do not. 
There is only one way to do it: 
You must surround and attack Penda himself with as many knights as you can." 
,"But when he sees so many knights, he will surely flee. 
Even if he is surrounded, a man determined to run can easily escape such a trap in the heat of battle." 
,"True, so you must strike him quickly, before he decides to run." 
You must kill him before he realizes that he is in danger." 
,"It sounds very difficult, Merlin." 
,"There is no other way. 
He hates you too much." 
,"If only I had understood these things a year ago. 
I could have warded off his hatred if only I had acted sooner." 
,"Indeed you could have. 
But you were much younger then, and the world was too complicated to allow you to see so far ahead. 
Even I miscalculated slightly." 
,"Merlin, could I not merely wait out my enemies? 
What if I were to simply wait and grow? 
Every month my kingdom grows stronger. 
Every month, I can add another man to my army without weakening the kingdom. 
Could I not simply stay here in Camelot, growing ever larger and larger, so that after many years, I am so
overwhelmingly powerful that even Penda would be forced to recognize me as liege?" 
,"Yes, you could do that, but only up to a point. 
Remember, Arthur, there is only so much land in the kingdom. 
It cannot grow wealthier forever; the day will come when every field is planted, every hill has cattle grazing. 
When that day comes, your kingdom cannot grow any wealthier. 
,"And how soon will that day come?" 
,"Well, I would say....hmmm....when you reach a total wealth of about 125 to 130 pieces of gold per week." 
,"I see. 
I will be reaching that in a few more years of peace." 
Then time will be working against me, for then the other kings will be catching up." 
,"Very slowly, to be sure." 
,"Even so, an army of 125 men, is a gigantic army. 
It could surely conquer any other king. 
Surely Penda would know that." 
,"Not necessarily. 
The bigger an army is, the more poorly it fights. 
The mighty knights spend less time fighting and more time getting the men organized. 
It is true that a larger army is more powerful than a smaller one, but not proportionately. 
Indeed, a knight burdened with 20 men-at-arms fights only twice as well as a knight with only five men-at-arms. 
Remember, too, that a knight is, by himself, three times more powerful than a normal man-at-arms. 
Thus, adding many men-at-arms does not increase your strength in battle as much as you might think." 
,"Well, then, I suppose I shall have to build it even larger than 130 men, using my vassals' tithes to pay." 
,"No, my king, you cannot build your army any bigger than 128 men. 
There are a limited number of young men in the kingdom to use for soldiers;
you must leave enough men to tend the crops." 
,"Very well, I shall fight him as you say until I kill him. 
Let us hope that it happens quickly. 
In the meantime, I have a request to make of you. 
I need you to change Uryen's heart so that he might feel warmer towards me. 
I may need that benefit in the times to come. 
I would rather have Uryens as my willing vassal than as my sullen victim." 
,"I will cast a spell that will soften his heart in your direction. 
Mind you, the spell will eventually wear off. 
It may not make him love you, but it will make things easier for him in the times to come. 
For you, King Arthur, are assured of final success now. 
I do believe that you fully understand all of the ways of kingship, and that you will reign victorious as king of
all Britain." 
,"Those are heartening words to hear from so demanding and critical a teacher as you have been, Merlin. 
Yet, I suspect that I will be feeling the lash of your critical tongue even long after I have won my throne. 
You will always have lectures to try my patience and tax my understanding." 
,"No, my lord, I shall not, for with this last request you make of me, my work here is done. 
I shall be taking my leave." 
,"What!?! 
Leave me? 
You cannot do that! 
How will I manage without you, Merlin, old friend?" 
,"You will manage very well indeed. 
You do not need me anymore; you are a fit, able, and wise king." 
,"But your magic is so important to my success. 
Without it I shall fail." 
,"You do not need my magic anymore. 
You can and must win this final victory on your own, without help from anybody. 
I know now that you can do that. 
Fear not---you will prevail. 
And now I shall return to the hills and forests from whence I came, and which have always supplied me with their
power. 
I yearn to sleep in my own home, among the oaks and menhirs, under the stars." 
,"I shall miss you sore unto my heart, dear friend." 
,"You need not, for I have always been an illusion. 
Look about you, at the sturdy oak trees, the serene rolling hills, and the quiet great boulders. 
Merlin is only the expression of the solemn power and silent wisdom of all these things. 
If you pause to notice, you will see my face in the moss-covered boulders and hear my voice in the wind. 
You will only miss me if you forget how to look and listen. 
Farewell, Arthur, king of men." 
.l1
.i0
He slowly faded from view. 
A moment later, there was nothing but the wind gently blowing. 
Arthur could indeed hear Merlin's voice whispering, "Farewell, Arthur" over and over again. 


.BDESIGNER'S NOTES
.CChris Crawford
.p
This game consumed far more time than I ever imagined possible. 
I had originally intended to do it myself in about 12 months' time. 
Twenty months have passed and two other people have been sucked in. 
The first deadline was March 1. 
That got pushed back to April 1. 
Then we fell all the way back to July 1. 
Today is July 24th, and woe betide any creature that attempts to stop
us from  delivering final code on July 29th. 
As with any properly done game, I am sick and tired of the whole enterprise, so tired that I no longer care
about it. 
.p
I look back on this project with both intense pride and deep regret. 
I take great pride in the many advances built into this game. 
It has some fantastic graphics, excellent sounds, a powerful collection of algorithms, and a magnificent manual. 
Towering over all these features, though, is the sheer size of the design. 
All the game subsystems are complex and tie together in the most intricate manner. 
The end result is a game with more texture, color, and feel than anything I am aware of. 
That is the greatest achievement of this game---the creation of an entire, working world. 
.p
The size of the game is also the source of all my regrets. 
There are far too many jury-rigged sections of this design, places where two structures intersected clumsily, and
I was forced to mate them by brute force. 
Moreover, this game is not as well playtested as it should be. 
A game this size needs thousands of hours of playtesting, not the hundreds we gave it. 
As a result, the game factors are not finely balanced enough to keep the player
perpetually balanced on the fine edge between triumph and disaster. 
.p
My greatest regret, though,
is that I failed to capture a reasonable fraction of the beauty and majesty of the
Arthurian legends. 
I love this body of literature, these glorious tales of
human greatness and folly, and I fear that I have not done them justice. 
Someday I will have to come back and try again, if only to make up for the shortcomings of this attempt. 
.p
Despite all the shortcomings and the failures, I remain immensely proud of th end result. 
It is the finest and best design I have worked on to date. 
Many of
its best features are directly attributable to the contributions of Larry Summers and Valerie Atkinson. 
Both Larry and Valerie labored long and hard to translate my sketchy design into reality. 
In the process, they exposed numerous flaws and suggested many excellent corrections and improvements. 
Towards the end of the project, I refused to make any important design decision without first seeking their
advice. 
They began the project as implementors and ended it as co-authors. 

.BTHE TRIAD EMERGES
.p
Peace settled over the troubled isle. 
It was not a peace of resolution, a peace of victory, or a peace of concord. 
It was instead an uneasy peace, a wary peace of preparation for more war. 
Penda's many campaigns had begun to weaken even his mighty army. 
He had been able to make good all of his losses, but the new men were not
as experienced as Penda's original army, and less experienced troops tend to suffer higher losses in battle. 
This can be a vicious circle, with greener troops dying more quickly, to be replaced by still greener troops,
who die even more quickly. 
Penda decided to halt the circle by suspending campaigning for a while so that he might bring up the standard of
training within his army. 
.p
Penda's respite forced the other kings of southern Britain to cease their campaigns. 
Penda on campaign brought terror to one king and relief to the others; Penda at home threatened everyone alike. 
Any king foolish enough to take his army away from his homeland would almost certainly return to a ravaged land. 
Further north, Uryens, Augusel, Idres, and Lot settled down to an equally uneasy truce, this one dictated
by exhaustion from frequent unsuccessful campaigns. 
Uryens had emerged as the clear leader with the most successful army, but he had been unable to force his will
on any of the other kings. 
.p
And so the kings of Britain stayed home for a time, rebuilding their armies and biding their time. 
Only Garwin, Colgrin, and Cheldric continued to embark on occassional raids, and these were minor nuisances to
all concerned. 
.p
For Arthur, the respite was a welcome relief. 
He had his hands full dealing with a ravaged land and a shattered army. 
If Penda's army was inexperienced, Arthur's was utterly green. 
It would take a year, perhaps, to bring these men up to an acceptable standard of performance. 
He intended to refrain from any offensive military action until his army was truly ready for battle. 
Until then, he would continue to pay tribute to Penda. 
.p
The loss of Lamerok and Gawain was made up for by the arrival of three new knights: Bedivere, Galahad, and
Mordred. 
Mordred was a vain charlatan with little aptitude for battle. 
It was obvious to Arthur that Mordred was almost useless on the battlefield. 
Yet, Mordred had a sweet and facile tongue with which he charmed the objects of his machinations. 
The more saintly knights resented his brashness and greasy glad-handing. 
Many of the knights, though, enjoyed his company. 
He had a talent for inspiring the confidence of the uncritical. 
Mordred lusted after any form of advancement he could lay his hands on. 
He lusted for money, and for power, and for the trappings of a good life. 
.p
Galahad, on the other hand, was in all ways the very opposite of Mordred. 
Where Mordred was a bumbling coward on the battlefield, Galahad was a lion. 
Where Mordred was consumed by his lusts for money and honor, Galahad cared for neither. 
Of all the knights of the Round Table, Galahad came closest to the knightly ideal of purity and modesty combined
in a mighty warrior. 
Yet Galahad's ascetic ways earned him the distrust of the other knights. 
Mordred, the champion of their foibles, seemed more human, more accomodating than Galahad, the embodiment of
their ideals. 
As Arthur learned more and more about this noble knight, his appreciation for him increased. 
.p
Bedivere was a decent if unimaginative sort. 
He was not a very good warrior, but he took his craft seriously and worked hard to improve his meager skills. 
In his quiet moments, he dreamed of being the equal of Lancelot, of sharing glory and wealth with the other
magnificent knights of the Round Table, but he was
modest enought to know that these things were reserved for more gifted knights than
he. 
.p
These new knights joined a Round Table that was no longer the happy place it had once been. 
Of the original six knights of the Round Table, only three still lived:
Sremmus, Lucas, and Kay. 
The room now seemed more filled with memories than expectations. 
And they were sad memories of lost comrades. 
The loss of Gawain was most rankling to all. 
The others had died fighting in fair combat, but Gawain had been abandoned, left trapped to face Penda's men. 
Although everyone acknowledged the military necessity of Arthur's decision, there remained an unspoken resentment
against the king who had left his knight behind. 
Penda's greatest success had not been the ravaging of Arthur's land and the shattering of his army;
his greatest success had been the destruction of the spirit and unity of the Round Table. 
.p
Arthur noticed it quite early. 
The knights no longer spoke freely with him. 
Their conversations with him were short and businesslike. 
Lancelot was distant and aloof. 
Lucas, who had never been particularly friendly, was now almost pointed in his avoidance of Arthur. 
Kay, Arthur's brother, was supportive but subdued; even he was affected by the rot. 
Sremmus was strange; he stayed close by Arthur and Gwynevere at meals, and went to great lengths to be of good
heart, but on the training ground he paid little heed to Arthur. 
It seemed to Arthur that Sremmus was putting on some sort of show, but to what end Arthur could not guess. 
.p
Much to Arthur's dismay, the new knights were quickly caught up in the black mood of the Round Table. 
They shared the excitement and optimism of their new lives with the other knights, but when Arthur appeared they
became as quiet and evasive as the others. 
.l1
.i10
"What am I to do, Merlin? 
My knights behave most sullenly around me. 
I have no authority over them; when I speak they seldom listen. 
If they do listen, it is only to argue with me. 
Each of them acts as if he were my equal, nay, my superior. 
How many times have I been lectured on proper military technique! 
Suddenly they are all experts and I am but a squire to whom everything must be explained. 
If I could but find the proper excuse, I would surely challenge one of them to single combat and spill the
ingrate's guts onto the dust to show the others that I am still king." 
,"Take care that it not be Lancelot, or you may be washing the dust from your own guts. 
Oh, foolish young one, you are mighty king and helpless child at once. 
Where a wise king would see problems, you see strife. 
You still cannot help but see all problems through the twisted eyes of your own pride. 
The matter at stake is not Arthur's authority, or the insolence of the knights. 
What has been lost is the group unity, the sense of comradeship that binds men together and makes kingdoms. 
You are the king, the personification of the kingdom. 
Their confidence in the kingdom, and in you, has been shaken to the core. 
They are no longer sure of the dream that you promised them of a Britain unified under one king. 
Foolish one, you cannot make men believe in a dream by spilling their guts in the sand. 
And you must not confuse your person with that dream. 
You can and must use your person to help them believe in that dream, for if they believe in Arthur, then they
will believe in the dream. 
But the king himself must always keep in mind the difference between the two." 
,"How can I make them believe, Merlin?" 
,"You must prove to them that the dream works, that the dream offers hope. 
There is nothing so effective in this as a victory in battle, nor anything so destructive to the dream as a
defeat. 
That is why the dream is now so dim to your knights; they have just suffered a devastating defeat. 
Time will heal the wounds of that defeat, even as it leaves scars." 
,"Should I fight a battle? 
Provoke a war with Penda?" 
,"Only if you wish to suffer another defeat. 
Battle is too risky a place to nurture dreams. 
For now, you must rely on less dramatic approaches. 
,"Perhaps I should offer them gifts of gold." 
,"Perhaps. 
But you are not wealthy enough to give freely, so you must weigh your charity carefully. 
Consider the impact a gift might have on each of the knights. 
For example, do you think that the saintly Galahad would be much impressed with a gift of gold?" 
,"No, I don't think so." 
,"Indeed not. 
Galahad is far too idealistic to allow mere gold to bend his heart. 
Sir Sremmus, on the other hand, does seem to enjoy his wealth. 
A gift to him might well be appreciated. 
The same can be said of Mordred." 
,"Mordred! 
Who cares about Mordred! 
The man is useless in battle. 
I care not how Mordred feels about me." 
,"It is true that Mordred's loyalty or treason is of little direct concern, but there are other considerations. 
Mordred's tongue may well influence other knights, and if so, it is best that it wag in your direction." 
,"Well, perhaps a small gift might be acceptable. 
But could I not give him some useless honor?" 
,"Absolutely not. 
Remember that, when you march to battle, the men-at-arms are divided among the knights according to each knight's
stature in the Round Table. 
Knights whom you have honored receive a larger share of the men-at-arms to command. 
To honor Mordred is to give him more men-at-arms to misuse." 
,"Then I shall honor my fine warriors, Galahad, Percivale, and Lancelot." 
,"Think again, King Arthur. 
It is true that Galahad is a fine warrior who will lead your men-at-arms well. 
But Galahad cares not for power over other men; honoring Galahad will make your army more effective but it will
not win Galahad's heart. 
On the other hand, Lancelot, who cares naught for wealth but lives for his honor and the approbation of his
king, will deeply appreciate any honors you bestow upon him. 
,"And Lancelot is a magnificent warrior who would lead my men-at-arms well. 
I shall honor Lancelot hugely and the others not at all." 
,"Hold, king. 
One knight does not an army make. 
Lancelot may be the finest knight in Britain, but he cannot win all of your battles for you. 
You need to bring many knights with you to your battles, for the leadership of even so great a knight
as Lancelot is strained when he commands so many men. 
It is good to give Lancelot a larger share of the men, but do not overwhelm his talents. 
The more knights you bring, the more powerful you will be, yet you want to give many of your men-at-arms to your
best knights. 
,"And honor my knights in such a way as to win their hearts as well." 
,"Indeed so."
,"Yes, and I'm not sure I like it. 
What you ask me to do is impossible. 
How can I weigh the pride of all of my knights against their prowess in battle and further against my need to
have them all accompany me to battle?" 
,"You are the king, Arthur. 
I am only a magician." 
.l1
.i0
The months passed. 
Arthur doled out gifts and honors, and with the passage of time the knights' hearts warmed to Arthur. 
The men trained hard, honing their skills to match the sharpness and brightness of their blades. 
The kingdom recovered from the ravages of Penda's attack, and the treasury slowly grew. 
The day came when Arthur decided that he could pay his tribute and pay for his army without taxing the kingdom
excessively. 
Using Merlin's magic, Arthur visited the castles of all the kings of Britain. 
He observed their different attempts to recover from the travails of the series of wars. 
Slowly, a plan began to form in his mind. 
King Pellinore was the focus of this plan. 
Like Arthur, Pellinore was paying tribute to Penda, considerably swelling Penda's treasury. 
The tribute payments so weakened Pellinore that he was unable to maintain a large army. 
A victory against Pellinore would greatly enhance Arthur's prestige, both with other kings and with his own men. 
Arthur was surprised that nobody else had attacked Pellinore for a long time;
perhaps they feared Penda's wrath. 
In this, Arthur felt safe; his tribute to Penda and his burgeoning army gave him a measure of protection. 
.p
And so, Arthur cast the die. 
He gathered all the notables of the kingdom together and declared war on Pellinore. 
In accordance with long-standing custom, he dispatched a messenger to Pellinore to announce his intentions. 
He then gathered his men for their first foreign campaign. 
The main task was to determine who would go and who would stay behind to defend Camelot. 
At first, Arthur was of a mind to leave behind Mordred and Lucas, but they both begged to be allowed to
join in the grand campaign. 
There was also the delicate question of treachery to be considered. 
More than one king who had left his castle in the hands of untrustworthy lieutenants had returned to find
the gates closed and the battlements manned against him. 
Arthur considered this possibility, but was loathe to leave behind a loyal and noble knight to watch the likes
of Mordred. 
So Arthur decided to take a chance. 
He had no real interest in pillaging Pellinore's kingdom. 
In fact, he had an aversion to the thought of the horrible destruction his men would wreak on the helpless
peasants of Pellinore's kingdom. 
Pillage was not Arthur's prize; prestige was. 
Arthur needed to win a battle, and Pellinore was the most likely candidate. 
He would
therefore leave Camelot undefended, sweep into Gwyned (Pellinore's kingdom), fight a single battle, and return
home in all haste. 
With luck, they would arrive home before any invading army. 
The timing was tight; if Penda chose to strike, he might beat Arthur and ravage the countryside again. 
The other risk was that if Arthur's losses against Pellinore were high, he
would be weakened and invite invasion. 
Merlin advised against the attack, claiming that it was far too risky, but
Arthur was willing to take the chance. 
The longer he waited, the more powerful Penda became. 
He had to do something to break the cycle. 
This was his best chance. 
.p
On the appointed day, Arthur stood by the gate at Camelot. 
Each knight approached in turn and dipped his lance to Arthur. 
Arthur draped an orange pennant over the lance, signifying that the knight was selected to accompany Arthur on
the campaign. 
Not a single green pennant (signifying that the knight must remain to defend Camelot) did Arthur drape over
any lance. 
Arthur thus marched out of Camelot at the head of his entire army: 20 men-at-arms with 7 knights. 
They marched due north, heading for Gwynedd. 
Merlin accompanied them in the form of a black raven. 
After five days, they came in sight of a magnificent castle. 
The men were very excited, thinking that they had arrived at Pellinore's castle. 
.l1
.i10
"Merlin, fly to yon castle and discover who rules it." 
.l1
.i0
The raven wheeled and flew off, its great black wings beating the air. 
It circled over the castle for a moment, then headed back. 
Upon returning to Arthur, it changed its form to Merlin. 
.l1
.i10
"That is the castle of King Royns. 
Twenty-five men stand ready to defend the kingdom against attackers. 
You must travel further north before you come to Pellinore's kingdom." 
.l1
.i0
Onward they trekked, passing peacefully through Royns' kingdom, until they arrived at the southern
edge of Gwynedd. 
There they began a perfunctory campaign of pillage to draw Pellinore out of his castle. 
Pellinore did not disappoint Arthur; the very next day the two armies faced each other across the meadow at
Pontesbury. 
.p
Pellinore had brought with him six knights and twelve men-at-arms. 
Arthur had the clear advantage. 
His plan of battle was much simpler than the disastrous plan he had used against Penda. 
His men would await Pellinore's advance. 
Galahad, on the extreme left flank, had no opponent facing him and so would advance ahead of the main battle
line. 
As Pellinore's army marched past to engage Arthur's main forces, Galahad would hold his position against any
attacks and then swing behind Pellinore's men to trap them. 
If Pellinore attacked Galahad first, Lucas, the closest knight to him, would break out of line and go to
Galahad's rescue. 
Otherwise, the battle was to be a straightforward man-on-man combat. 
.p
The first shock was the attack of the peasants. 
This was the first time that Arthur had fought on foreign soil, and he had not prepared himself emotionally for
the assault of the peasants. 
His men handled themselves well, driving the peasants off with the loss of only three men. 
Arthur nevertheless felt some dismay at even that loss. 
If his men had been better trained, he noted, they would not have lost any men. 
Nevertheless, the situation was still well in hand. 
.p
The rest of the battle was actually rather dull. 
Pellinore's men advanced, ignoring Galahad. 
Galahad swung around behind them according to plan. 
Combat was joined all along the front. 
On the left flank, Galahad and Lucas overwhelmed Pellinore's men and began to roll up the line. 
Before they got far, Pellinore's men began to fall back. 
Soon, Pellinore's entire army was retreating. 
Arthur's men chased them off the battlefield. 
That was the end of the battle of Pontesbury. 
.p
Arthur wasted no time in pursuing Pellinore or further pillaging his land; there was no need to deepen the
hatred he had already engendered. 
He turned his army back and raced for Camelot. 
They made it back in six days. 
To his great relief, he returned to find a peaceful kingdom. 
His attack had been carried out with such speed that no one had had the time to react. 
.l1
.i10
"Well, Merlin, you were wrong this time. 
You warned of dire consequences, yet we all came back safe and sound, and not a grain of our wheat was burned. 
Admit it: this time you were wrong." 
,"Happily I will admit that none of the calamities I feared materialized. 
Yet, the situation is not so sparkling as you seem to think. 
You have attacked a king who loved you and never did you harm; now the other kings will not trust you. 
Five of your men-at-arms lay rotting on Pontesbury meadow; until their replacements are trained, you are
vulnerable. 
,"That's true, Merlin, but I have a way to compensate: I am going to raise the army to 25 men-at-arms." 
,"25 men-at-arms? 
The kingdom cannot afford the cost!" 
,"Yes, it can. 
There remains a considerable amount of untaxed wealth in the kingdom." 
,"That wealth is necessary for the further growth of the economy. 
If you tax that, you eliminate your future and guarantee that you will never grow beyond your current size. 
Do you think that you can conquer Britain with an army of 25 men? 
You'll need a fair lot more than that, and a kingdom that can support it, to complete your task." 
,"I can raise the money without taxing the kingdom into penury. 
There will still be growth." 
,"Yes, but how rapid will the growth be? 
Fast enough to reach the level you need in your lifetime? 
I doubt that." 
.l1
.i0
.p
A page interrupted their argument. 
An important visitor had arrived; Arthur was required in the throne room. 
The visitor turned out to be none other than King Horsa of Cantware. 
.l1
.i10
"Noble King Arthur, I come to seek your protection and offer myself as your vassal. 
Long was I kindly inclined towards your claim to be rightful king of all Britain. 
I applauded your victory over Hengist and offered tribute to your grace afterwards. 
However, King Penda of Mercia did oppress both of us, making war upon the both of us. 
I offered him tribute in the hope that his depradations against my people would cease, but he has recently
resumed his attacks against my land. 
It is with great gladness that I hear of your victory over King Pellinore. 
Surely this victory is a harbinger of more victories to come. 
I therefore offer myself as your vassal." 
.l1
.i0
.p
Arthur turned slightly to stare pointedly at Merlin. 
Merlin looked quite vexed and left the throne room. 
.l1
.c**************
.l1
.p
Arthur demanded and got a tithe of ten pieces of gold per week. 
With the additional funds, he increased his army to 30 men-at-arms. 
At the same time, he was able to reduce taxes somewhat, guaranteeing continued strong growth. 
.p
His army was now very large, not as large as Penda's, but certainly large enough to face an attack from Penda
with reasonable hope of success. 
After all, Penda could not hope to bring his entire army with him on any campaign. 
Every king in southern Britain would leap at the chance to pillage Penda's kingdom while he was away. 
The weakness of Arthur's army lay in its inexperience. 
In just a few months, it had grown from fifteen men to thirty. 
Thus, half of the men were completely inexperienced. 
An army like this could not possibly campaign on foreign soil. 
But it could defend the homeland well. 
Arthur now needed time, lots of time, to train his men and bring up their standard of performance. 
He had every reason to believe that he would have that time. 
.p
Things were looking very good for Arthur. 
He was liegelord to three kingdoms, encompassing much of southern Britain. 
His only rival, Penda, had subdued two other kings and was now embarking
on a new round of pillage, but he seemed content to leave Arthur alone. 
Instead, he terrorized the smaller kings of middle Britain, trying to bully them into submission. 
Arthur's army was strong and growing stronger daily as the men trained. 
The kingdom of Camelot was healthy, with increasing wealth every week. 
Arthur's vassals also shared in the general prosperity, for their military expenditures had been reduced. 
Merlin had to admit that, even though Arthur had not followed his advice exactly, things were going very well. 
.p
Yet, Merlin had understood the ways of the Fates better than Arthur, for they cannot abide by undiluted success,
and they insure that unsullied good fortune will breed its own adversity. 
Arthur first sensed that something was wrong during a feast at the Round Table celebrating the second anniversary
of his wedding to Gwynevere. 
The crowd seemed strangely subdued, lacking the exuberance that he was accustomed to during such festivities. 
He shrugged it off; perhaps it was the wine. 
He worked long days in the treasury room, going over the kingdom's finances, looking for waste and inefficiency. 
He meted out justice in the throne room and spent many hours listening to the messengers with tales of the
activities of the other kings. 
But as the weeks rolled by, he became more aware of an unpleasant mood in the castle. 
It was not the sullen, rebellious feeling that had descended onto the knights after the defeat to Penda. 
This was more of a guilty mood. 
It seemed to Arthur that everyone was slinking away from him with their tails between their legs. 
Even Gwynevere shared in it. 
She certainly tried to put on a brave show---always going off on a round of activities and entertainments,
keeping people busy with all manner of projects. 
But she avoided Arthur, always begging leave to attend to some enterprise that demanded her attention. 
.p
The gloom was becoming serious. 
The whole kingdom seemed caught in its grip. 
It grew to the point that people were edgy and defensive, fearful and unhappy. 
Arthur spoke to everyone he could about it, and each person insisted that all was well, he or she was quite
happy and had no complaints. 
Even Merlin had nothing to offer. 
.p
Arthur climbed to the top of the highest battlement and there he brooded. 
What was this malaise that oppressed his people? 
It seemed that they all knew something terrible that he didn't, yet he could feel the gloominess stretching
its icy fingers into his heart. 
There was no reason to be downhearted, yet it was contagious. 
.p
He pondered all afternoon and past sunset, staring into the distance. 
In the growing dusk, he noticed two people emerge from the forest a mile from the castle. 
They seemed to be strolling together. 
The sight of them cheered Arthur. 
At least there is still room for romance and love in Camelot, he thought. 
We are not completely lost yet. 
He watched them approach the castle, hand in hand, and wondered,
what do these happy people have that everyone else seems to have lost? 
Then, with a start, he recognized them: it was Sremmus and Gwynevere. 
.p
Half an hour later, the throne room was packed with all the worthies of the kingdom. 
Arthur sat on his throne, looking fierce and terrible. 
Sremmus and Gwynevere stood before him. 
.l1
.i10
"For your crimes, I banish you both from my domains. 
Leave Camelot forever." 
.l1
.i0
Arthur paused. 
He wanted to say more, to express the love he had felt for both of them, to recall the many battles that Sremmus
had accompanied him in, or to convey his regret that they had done so foolish a thing. 
But there was nothing else to say. 
Abruptly, he rose and left. 
.l1
.i10
"It is coming, Merlin. 
I can feel it. 
The times of happiness, the boyish times of adventure and conquest, they are gone. 
The clouds of war are gathering. 
The kings of Britain have been gathering their strength for some time. 
Now they are ready. 
For the last six months, they have maneuvered for position. 
Now the death struggle will begin. 
There will be many battles, much bloodshed, and no quarter. 
I am ready." 
.l1
.i0
He left.
.l1
.i10
"Ah, King Arthur, at last you have grown up. 
You are a foolish and carefreee young man no longer. 
I grieve for you." 
.l1
.i0
.c************
.p
The messenger told his tale of battles and conquest. 
Far in the north, King Uryens had emerged triumphant from the wars there. 
They had built steadily to a climax, with each king desperately trying to raise men fast enough to crush his
opponent while he was still weak. 
In their frenzy for advantage, kings had led armies of untrained youths, hardly better than peasants with armor,
into wild and desperate battles. 
The chronicle of fighting seemed endless. 
The ambitious Lot had campaigned against one and all in the area, exhausting his forces and his kingdom. 
He had then faced attacks from all sides, and his weakened armies were unable to prevent his lands from being
devastated. 
Defeated, he eventually sought protection from Idres. 
Uryens attacked both Idres and Lot many times, but was unable to defeat them. 
In a climactic battle, Uryens slew Idres on the battlefield, capturing two kingdoms with a single sword-stroke. 
Augusel, realizing that his position was hopeless, held out for a while before recognizing Uryens as
his liege. 
Exhausted from his many campaigns, Uryens had paused to rebuild
and expand his army with the extortionate tithes he now
extracted from his unfortunate vassals. 
.p
Meanwhile, in the country's midsection, Penda had continued his petty warfare, driving many kings to the brink of
ruin but inflaming their emnity against him, thereby guaranteeing their refusal to accept him as their liege. 
Only Pellinore had succumbed to Penda's ravages. 
Colgrin, Baldulf, Garwin, Royns, and Cheldric retained their independence, but their armies were all weakened. 
They engaged in petty warfare against each other. 
.p
Thus, from the confusion and chaos of the campaigns, three kings emerged as the dominant kings of Britain:
Uryens, Penda, and Arthur. 
One of them would become king of all Britain. 
Each one knew that, and each one intended to make himself that king. 
.BPENDA

.i10
"Well, Merlin, what think you of young Arthur now? 
I have conquered and slain the hated King Hengist and his kingdom is now my vassalage. 
A fair week's work, wouldn't you say? 
When shall we begin the conquest of the rest of Britain?" 
,"Indeed you have done well, my king, but your small success has robbed you of your senses. 
You would do well to wait for a while before taking any action." 
,"What? 
Wait? 
My men are eager for action and ready to conquer any enemy I signify. 
Hengist led the finest army in southern Britain. 
If we can beat it, we can beat any army." 
,"But you did not defeat Hengist's army. 
You killed Hengist. 
Had you not been so lucky, you would have won the battle, but Hengist would have escaped to fight again. 
,"Lucky? 
It was not luck that planted that spear in Hengist's back." 
,"I tell you that Hengist's attack on your person was not the foolish gesture you thought it to be. 
He meant only to surprise and stun you, and then to retreat from the battlefield. 
So intent were both of you on your single combat that neither one saw Sremmus steal up from behind. 
Luck, my boy, created your good fortune. 
It is therefore unseemly for you to swagger about so." 
,"I shall accept your verdict, Merlin, but I will not tell my men; after so many defeats at Hengist's hands I
will let them relish their victory. 
What next, then? 
You say I should wait. 
Why so?" 
,"You have been weakened by the wars with Hengist. 
Your army is of only moderate size and has suffered some losses. 
Moreover, you have lost two good knights, Drofwarc and Nosnikta. 
You need time for other knights to offer their services, and time to rebuild and enlarge your army. 
Above all, you need time to allow your men to train themselves
so that they can meet a veteran army on the field. 
They are still relatively inexperienced. 
They are probably adequate for defensive battles but are hopelessly unprepared for campaigns outside of
the kingdom. 
Someday you will need to lead the army on campaigns; when that day comes, you will need an army up to the task. 
Finally, you may not realize it, but you are not fully in control of your fate. 
There are other kings, kings with ambitions to rule Britain. 
You are a threat to them, a threat that can no longer be ignored now that you have conquered Hengist. 
Your prestige has increased enormously, for Hengist was widely feared. 
Ambitious kings look on you with envy and fear; timid kings will look to you for protection. 
The enemies of Hengist, and they were many, look on you warmly, while his few friends are now your enemies. 
You have set the pot bubbling well, and there is no way to say what will come out of it. 
But it is certain that you do not need to stir it. 
Be patient! 
Trouble will come to you soon enough, impatient young one." 
.i0
.l1
They were interrupted by a page announcing the arrival of a contingent of knights from Lundenwic. 
The knights bore the weekly tithe of ten pieces of gold. 
Arthur repaired to the treasury room to adjust his budget accordingly. 
This new income was quite a boon. 
He raised his army expenditure to twenty pieces of gold per week and at the
same time, lowered his taxes slightly. 
This still left a small surplus to go into the treasure chest. 
Arthur decided that he very much liked receiving tithes from vassals. 
The only liability was the requirement to defend them against all attackers. 
Up to
half of his home army would be required to ride to the aid of the resident army if Lundenwic were attacked. 
He could inherit much trouble. 
Still, a 50% increase in his budget made it all worthwhile. 
.p
Months passed. 
The new recruits trained, and the army slowly rebuilt itself. 
A new knight, Percivale, was added to the comradeship of the Round Table. 
Percivale was a country boy who had become one of Arthur's men-at-arms. 
He had distinguished himself with exceptional bravery at the battle of Cerdicesford. 
Friendly and outgoing, Percivale was well-liked by all the knights. 
Moreover, behind his rude ways there lay a good-hearted honesty and basic common sense that impressed all who
knew him. 
The other knights made jokes about him that even Percivale laughed at, but they all listened when he spoke. 
When Lancelot suggested that Percivale be knighted, they all acclaimed Lancelot's proposal. 
And so Arthur tapped Percivale's shoulders with Excalibur and proclaimed him a knight. 
Still a country bumpkin at heart, Percivale was uncomfortable with the trappings of knighthood. 
He enjoyed the income and wealth that accrued to any knight, but was uneasy with the command of other men. 
.P
Meanwhile, Britain reverberated from the marching of armies. 
Kings campaigned on one another with energy and enthusiasm. 
In the north, Uryens and Augusel were locked in a relentless war; from his distance, Arthur could not tell who
had the upper hand. 
South of them, Lot and Colgrin engaged in complex maneuvers against each other and neighboring kings. 
Despite a great deal of maneuvering and campaigning, very few battles were fought;
as soon as a king left to campaign on another king, a third king would set out to ravage the departed king's
territory. 
This would force the original aggressor to return to defend his homeland before he could consummate his
campaign. 
Thus, despite all the marching, very few battles were fought. 
.p
Arthur's most immediate concern was with Penda, King of Mercia, directly to Arthur's north. 
Penda attacked and cowed Sater into submission; it was one of the few successful acts of aggression in the series
of wars just being fought. 
The success of this campaign stirred Arthur to pay closer attention to Penda. 
He sought out the advice of Merlin. 
.l1
.i10
"Tell me, Merlin, what manner of man is Penda?" 
,"Penda is a dangerous man. 
He possesses not the
all-consuming hatred that so dominated Hengist, yet neither is he constrained by charitable feelings. 
Penda is instead stubborn and will hold a grudge to extremity. 
Above all, however, he is ambitious; he craves power and glory. 
The combination of such strong ambition in a king so determined and
willful makes Penda a most dangerous opponent. 
Fortunately, his military prowess is not so keen, although his men are devoted to him. 
You would do well to watch Penda closely and be ready for an attack." 
,"Why not visit his castle?" 
,"Shall we go?" 
.l1
.i0
In the twinkle of an eye they were there. 
Arthur spent less time gaping and went straight to the matter at hand, poring over Penda's fiscal documents,
sizing up the nature of this king. 
What he found disturbed him deeply. 
Penda's kingdom was already quite rich and yielded considerable revenues with little strain. 
Moreover, the tithes from Sater's kingdom were much larger than those Arthur was receiving from Lundenwic. 
It all added up to a huge budget, and Penda was using it to build an appropriate army. 
Over 40 men-at-arms stood in Penda's service. 
Even worse, Penda's battles had all been victories, and his losses had been low. 
Consequently, his army's ranks were filled with many veterans, much more experienced than Arthur's men. 
Arthur shook his head in dismay. 
Here was an army that could crush his should Penda decide to march. 
.p
The situation in the throne room was more reassuring. 
Merlin's magic showed how Penda felt towards each of the other kings. 
With great relief, Arthur observed that Penda felt no great hatred for him. 
.l1
.i10
"At least I have time before I have to face Penda. 
See how he hates Augusel, Lot, and Colgrin more than me." 
,"Do not deceive yourself, Arthur. 
Penda loved Sater more than he loves you, yet Sater was his first victim. 
Penda is not the slave of his emotions; he will attack whomever he calculates it is best to attack." 
.l1
.i0
Merlin winked; they were back in Camelot. 
A page appeared, urgently importuning Arthur to come to the throne room, as a messenger had arrived. 
Ignoring Merlin's baleful "I told you so" expression, Arthur went to the throne room, full of misgivings. 
As he entered the room, the messenger dropped to his knees. 
.l1
.i10
"Most noble King Arthur, I bring you greetings from King Horsa of Cantwale. 
My king sends his congratulations for your defeat of the evil King Hengist and acquisition of his kingdom. 
He also sends, as a token of his goodwill, this tribute of six pieces of gold per week. 
This is the first payment."
.l1
.i0
Arthur took the small bag and set it on the arm of the throne. 
He was too stunned to respond immediately. 
Merlin had certainly been right when he had predicted that Arthur's victory over Hengist would attract attention
all over the island. 
But this was hard to believe---another king voluntarily offering tribute because of a single victory! 
.l1
.i10
"King Arthur thanks King Horsa for the tribute offered. 
Arthur will always look on Horsa with goodwill." 
,"Indeed, most noble Arthur, my master Horsa has always felt the deepest affection for you, and rejoiced greatly
in your victory." 
,"You may tell your king that Arthur doth love him equally. 
Go now and give him my message." 
.l1
.i0
Arthur could hardly contain himself. 
He hastened back to Merlin's room. 
.l1
.i10
"You must be slipping, old man. 
You spoke of gloom and despair, but the messenger was not here to announce my demise at Penda's hands;
instead, he came to offer tribute from Horsa. 
It seems that King Horsa has realized that I am indeed the true king, and is
hastening to make his peace with me." 
,"Think ye so, young fool? 
Think again: now that Hengist is no more, what possible enemies could Horsa have? 
Not Hoel; he has no ambitions of conquest. 
Not Royns or Cheldric; they have their hands full living in the shadow of Penda. 
Most of the other kings are too far away to matter much. 
That leaves just you and Penda as threats to Horsa. 
But Horsa neither loves nor trusts Penda, knowing his character. 
Would it not be best, then, to insure that Penda and Arthur keep each other fully occupied? 
By offering you a trivial amount of tribute, he guarantees that you will not attack him AND that you will be
stronger in defending yourself against Penda. 
He therefore neutralizes the only two kings who could be a threat to him." 
,"But, Merlin, it matters not why Horsa offers tribute;
the fact of the tribute will be interpreted everywhere as a
further confirmation of my rightful claim as king. 
This may well convince old Hoel to at last accept me as his liegelord. 
And when that happens, I will rule, directly or indirectly, all of southern Britain. 
I will be unstoppable." 
,"True; even as we speak, King Hoel weighs the arguements in your favor. 
Yet, he is reluctant to cast his lot in with a young king who may only drag him into deeper wars. 
Hoel wants a king, not a conquerer. 
Even as Hoel dithers, Penda prepares. 
Which will move first?" 
.l1
.i0
Three weeks later, Merlin's question was answered. 
A messenger arrived at Camelot. 
As Arthur stepped into the throne room to receive his message, he told himself,
"This is it---victory or defeat". 
.p
The messenger unrolled his parchment and began to read. 
It was a declaration of war from Penda. 
.p
It was a calm time of preparation for Arthur and his men. 
They knew of the size of Penda's army, but they had been outnumbered before. 
More important, they were much more powerful, too. 
They were confident of their ability to handle Penda as they had eventually handled Hengist. 
.p
The two armies confronted each other at Cynemaeresford, just inside the border of Arthur's domain. 
Penda's army was huge; he had brought along 30 of his 40 men-at-arms, leaving behind only 10 men to defend
his kingdom from opportunistic enemies. 
Compared to them, Arthur's army of 20 men-at-arms looked weak. 
Yet there were always the peasants, who had repeatedly decimated invading armies, and would surely take their
toll this time as in times past. 
Arthur was apprehensive but ready to fight. 
.p
He even had a plan this time. 
Realizing the numerical superiority of Penda's army, he intended to swing his men over to his left, thereby
concentrating the bulk of his forces against Penda's right wing. 
If the maneuver were carried out smoothly, he would be able to roll up Penda's army, always concentrating more
men against Penda's front than Penda would have available. 
The risk of his plan was to his own right wing, which would face Penda alone. 
.p
The battle began, and the peasants charged forward for their customary role. 
Penda's veterans did not disdain them as Hengist's had. 
They reacted to the peasant charge by deploying into a looser formation in which each soldier could fight more
freely. 
Against heavy cavalry a loose formation would fail, but against undisciplined peasants it was ideal. 
Penda's knights then met the peasant charge with a short countercharge of their own. 
It was all over in less than a minute. 
Fighting furiously, they slaughtered the peasants with almost no loss to themselves. 
The survivors fled the field in shock and terror. 
Then Penda's veterans re-formed and continued their advance on Arthur. 
.p
Fortunately for the morale of Arthur's men, they had been much too busy cross-marching to observe the ignominious
slaughter of the peasants. 
The maneuver Arthur had planned was a little too tricky for them to pull off smoothly. 
They were still juggling their positions when Penda's men bore down on them. 
Some were so involved in their maneuvering that they were unable to turn to face their opponents before combat
began. 
.p
Despite this, things went reasonably well on the left. 
Arthur had a solid numerical advantage there and pressed hard with it. 
Much to his dismay, however, he found that it was his men and not Penda's who were not being properly brought to
bear. 
Frantically he shouted at Gawain to bring his men around and into the fight, but Gawain couldn't seem to turn
the corner and get behind the enemy men-at-arms. 
Lucas's men were in the way. 
Penda's men, however, were experienced veterans. 
They sagged under the pressure but they held firm. 
.p
The situation on the right was much worse. 
Arthur's men there, Lamerok, Lancelot, and Sremmus, had to face almost all of Penda's army. 
Their losses began to mount. 
Lancelot was a lion and faced Penda himself. 
But when Lamerok and his men were wiped out, Sremmus succumbed to panic and fled the field. 
.p
Arthur pulled Lancelot back, but Penda's men were already turning onto Arthur. 
Arthur suddenly found himself facing Penda, two enemy knights, and about 10 enemy men-at-arms. 
He tried to backpeddle but stumbled into Kay. 
At this point, Lucas lost his nerve and began to fall back. 
Gawain, having finally gotten around Lucas, was now cut off from the rest of the army. 
At this point Arthur realized that the battle was lost and his greatest concern became extricating as many men
as possible from the battlefield. 
He ordered Gawain to come back around and hoped he could hold on long enough to cover Gawain's retreat. 
Kay, Arthur, and Lancelot were the only effective men left on the field. 
He forged a short line, trying to hold off Penda's masses while Gawain fell back. 
But the force of Penda's attack was too great. 
Arthur realized that he would lose Lancelot and Kay if he tried to stay any longer. 
There was nothing to do but run. 
His last guard fell before him; he now had to face Penda's men alone. 
Lancelot and Kay got away with their men; Arthur was right behind them. 
Arthur had one last glimpse of Gawain desperately trying to cut through the wall of men between him and safety. 
He did not see Gawain fall, and did not care to witness it. 
Conscious of the danger still hanging over his army, he put spurs to his horse and fled. 
.p
It was a bitter defeat. 
Two knights, Lamerok and Gawain, had been lost. 
Half of Arthur's army, ten men-at-arms, had fallen. 
Only six of Penda's men had been killed. 
It was a black day indeed. 
Penda spent several weeks pillaging the kingdom, but Arthur would not emerge from the castle. 
Fortunately, Penda was forced to return to his kingdom to beat off an attack by Cheldric. 
This small scrap of good news was offset by the announcement that Horsa would no longer pay tribute to Arthur. 
.l1
.i10
"What am I to do now, Merlin? 
Why have these calamaties befallen me?" 
,"You have suffered a great loss of prestige, young king. 
The defeat you suffered at the hands of Penda has tarnished your image in the eyes of the other kings. 
Perhaps you are not the successor to Uther Pendragon, they muse. 
King Horsa feels bolder, and decides he has nothing to gain by paying you tribute, for you are no longer either
a threat to Horsa or a counterbalance to Penda." 
,"Is it all over, Merlin? 
Will I never regain the strength I once had? 
Am I doomed to spend the rest of my reign cowering in Penda's shadow?" 
,"If you keep fighting battles like that last one, I can console you that your sufferings will not last long. 
As to your other future, despair not; the road in front of you is a long one, but there are many twists in it. 
Penda is but one of many kings; you are well-loved by other kings; Penda's attack on you has earned him many
enemies. 
Things can turn for the better." 
,"But how can I prevent Penda from pillaging my land at his leisure? 
I feel so helpless." 
,"Helplessness is only for those who lack imagination. 
You have many options. 
You can rebuild your army. 
Your best short-term option is to pay tribute to Penda." 
,"Me? King Arthur? Pay tribute to my worst enemy?" 
,"You certainly wouldn't pay tribute to your vassals, would you? 
Penda has demonstrated that he can take your wealth at his pleasure. 
If you give him tribute, he may be satisfied, and it will cost you less than an invasion." 
,"But then I will never be able to afford an army capable of defeating Penda." 
,"Not so long as you pay him tribute. 
But you will not need to pay tribute forever---only so long as Penda has the advantage. 
Pay him now, keep him happy. 
As soon as he loses a big battle, you can suspend payment of tribute as Horsa did with you." 
,"It makes sense..." 
,"Indeed so. 
Everybody does it." 
.i0
.l1
So Arthur offered tribute of five coins per week to Penda. 
The tribute seemed to work, for on his next campaign, Penda marched not against Arthur but against Hoel. 
Penda's men brutally ravaged the land, and Hoel's kingdom was devastated. 
Arthur's cheeks burned as he learned of the destruction of his father-in-law's kingdom; Gwynevere cried out for
revenge. 
She wanted Arthur to march immediately to Dumnonia to help Hoel defend his land against Penda. 
Together, she said, they could defeat Penda. 
The knights all supported Gwynevere's pleas, for they were eager to revenge the defeat at Cynemaeresford. 
Moreover, they all loved their charming queen and felt deeply her anguish. 
But such an act would have violated all the traditions of the land. 
Kings do not join forces on the battlefield, for that would dishonor their sovereignty. 
A liege can and indeed must come to the aid of his vassal, but not another king. 
Arthur considered launching a diversionary attack against Penda's homeland in the hopes of drawing Penda off,
but Merlin counseled against the idea. 
In the first place, it was the wrong time to be antagonizing Penda. 
In the second place, there were undoubtedly other kings considering the same course of action. 
It would be prudent to let a stronger king tackle Penda. 
For now, the best thing to do would be to wait. 
Gwynevere fumed in silence. 
.p
When Penda finally returned to Mercia, he left behind a wrecked and burned land. 
Its farms were in shambles, its people decimated, its army destroyed. 
King Hoel, beaten and despondent, appeared in Arthur's court. 
.l1
.i10
"My kingdom is ruined. 
I appeal to you for protection, and offer myself as your vassal in the hope that you will protect my land from
further ravages." 
,"Why do you turn to me? 
I am not as strong as I once was. 
Why do you not turn to Penda?" 
,"I may be beaten, but I am still a king. 
I will not crawl on my knees to a king whom I hate so strongly. 
You, Arthur, are a good and fair king; you are the rightful ruler of the land. 
You have never done me or my friends wrong. 
Your enemies---Hengist and Penda---are my enemies. 
I shall cast my lot in with yours. 
Even if you are weak now, you will be stronger soon enough. 
I doubt not your star." 
.l1
.i0
Together Arthur and Hoel returned to Hoel's castle. 
After examining the situation, Arthur asked for a tithe of only five gold coins per week. 
It was a small tithe to ask in return for the responsibility of protecting Hoel, but it was all the devastated
kingdom could afford. 
Someday, when it had recovered, it would make a larger contribution. 

.BSECOND BATTLE
.p
In the weeks before Hengist's army reached the kingdom, Arthur and his men trained hard and well. 
Arthur resisted the urge to frantically increase the size; he added only two new men. 
For the most part, he concentrated on building the morale of his men. 
He knew that this battle would be won or lost not with numbers but in the hearts of his men. 
.P
Arthur used Merlin's magic to check on Hengist's army a second time. 
To his dismay, he discovered that Hengist had raised the size of his army to 40 men-at-arms. 
This army was much too large to face. 
After much deliberation, he decided that he needed further use of Merlin's magic. 
.l1
.i10
"I need you again, Merlin. 
You must cause a plague to descend upon Hengist's army. 
Only then will I be able to face Hengist." 
,"A plague you desire? 
That is difficult magic---it will take much of my strength to do it." 
,"But you can do it, can you not?" 
,"Yes, I can, but must you take so drastic a step?" 
,"Hengist marches on my country with an army that could be twice the size of my own! 
Can you imagine a better time for drastic action?" 
,"No, I suppose not. 
Very well, it shall be done. 
But after I have done what you require, I shall go take my rest, and I shall not return until I am recovered." 
,"Yes, yes, do it. 
Hurry!" 
.l1
.i0
.p
Merin's magic worked perfectly. 
A terrible plague descended upon Hengist's army, and many of his men died. 
Arthur was satisfied. 
His men, hearing the news, were overjoyed that so formidable an opponent had been laid so low. 
Yet Hengist did not allow this disaster to deter him from his object. 
He continued toward Camelot. 
.p
When the word came that Hengist's army had reached the kingdom, all the knights and men-at-arms cheered. 
They were ready and eager to meet Hengist on the battlefield. 
They were confident of their ability to conquer his depleted army. 
They rode out of Camelot boisterous and confident. 
The contrast with their earlier battles was a joy for Arthur. 
Then they rode out to do their duty, expecting to lose, fearing to die. 
Now they were full of fight. 
With an army like this, Arthur thought, I really could conquer all of Britain. 
.p
They met Hengist on a small field at Cerdicesford. 
Hengist had brought eight knights and 20 men-at-arms. 
Arthur had seven knights and 20 men-at-arms. 
But when the peasants had finished their work, the odds had shifted: three of Hengist's men-at-arms were killed
by the ferocious peasants. 
.p
Arthur, anticipating this, was confident of victory and had a simple battle plan. 
Each knight was to drive straight forward into the enemy. 
Once battle had been joined he would modify their orders in accordance with circumstances. 
.p
Nosnikta's men charged forward with more enthusiasm than discretion. 
Arthur was pleased to see such spirit and energy. 
Lamerok raced up on his great black stallion. 
The horse pivoted and stopped within inches of Arthur. 
.l1
.i10
"Stop that idiot!" Lamerok shouted, gesturing toward Nosnikta. 
"His men are spurring their horses too hard. 
Those horses will be blown by the time battle is joined." 
,Arthur hesitated. 
"But..." 
,"If their horses are blown, those men won't stand a chance against Hengist's men. 
It takes an experienced horseman to charge a horse like that and keep it moving during battle. 
Make them rest those animals." 
.l1
.i0
Arthur signalled to a squire, who galloped off to relay the order. 
Lamerok shot an evil glance at Nosnikta, shook his head, and went back to his place. 
Arthur muttered a Celtic obscenity to himself. 
Battle had not even been joined and things were already screwed up. 
.p
Nosnikta's men were halted but not soon enough to properly rest the horses. 
Hengist's men hit with surprising impact. 
Nosnikta's men were quickly killed and Nosnikta himself, shaken and badly outnumbered, fell back under
the pressure. 
Gawain also had problems, and Arthur pulled him back for a moment to rest. 
But Sremmus, Kay, and Lucas hacked through Hengist's men with wild abandon. 
The entire right flank of Hengist's army folded up and ran. 
Arthur sent Lucas after the remnants to make sure they did not return. 
Meanwhile, Sremmus swung around to attack Hengist himself, who was pressing Arthur fairly hard. 
Kay came around from behind to support Nosnikta, but he was too late;
Nosnikta fell in a single duel with one of Hengist's knights. 
Hengist's left flank, having gained the upper hand over Arthur's men, was now pressing them hard, trying to
drive them off the battlefield. 
This was the crucial test of Arthur's training. 
Would the men break and run, or would they hold until Kay and Sremmus arrived to right the situation? 
They wavered; Arthur could see they were in dire straights. 
.p
His worries about his army were interrupted by a hard bang on his arm. 
He turned to confront Hengist himself, raising his sword for another blow. 
His last guard had just been killed, and Hengist, instead of running for the protection of another
knight, had charged straight through Arthur's two guards to force a final duel himself. 
Not having time for a proper defense, he tried to back the horse up, away from the descending blade, but the
horse balked and nearly stumbled. 
Just then the heavy sword crashed down on the bottom of Arthur's shield, glanced off his leg, and buried itself
in the horse's side. 
The horse screamed; blood poured over Arthur's leg. 
Arthur raised Excalibur to thrust back; he heard somebody cry, "The king is sore wounded!"
Down came Hengist's blade again, to be met this time by Excalibur. 
Thrusting Hengist's sword sideways, Arthur swung Excalibur straight into Hengist's shield, making a deep dent but
failing to shake Hengist's grip on it. 
He struck a second time, even harder, but still without effect. 
Again and again he hacked away at Hengist's shield,
cursing, trying to break Hengist's defense, but he would not let go. 
Hengist's own attempts to parry Arthur's strokes were unsuccessful. 
Seized by a wild fury, Arthur chopped futilely at Hengist. 
Suddenly Hengist slumped and fell out of the saddle, a spear protruding from his back. 
Breathless, Arthur looked up from the body. 
Sremmus smiled back at him. 
.l1
.c*************
.p
The column of men wound down the little road leading to the castle. 
In front was Arthur, followed by his knights, then the men-at-arms. 
As they approached the castle, the drawbridge lowered, and in they rode, into Hengist's castle. 
Anxious eyes awaited them. 
Hengist's queen, Malmagest, stood in front of a group of nobles, tragic and proud. 
Arthur dismounted and she knelt before him. 
.p
In the throne room Arthur seated himself on the throne that had once been Hengist's. 
One by one, the nobles of Hengist's domain presented themselves to Arthur. 
Arthur would extend his hands toward the noble, holding them about a foot apart. 
The noble would respond by extending his clasped hands toward Arthur, placing them between Arthur's . 
The ceremony of vassalage completed, Arthur stood up and went into the treasury room, accompanied by the
noble responsible for collecting taxes. 
.p
He examined the documents there, pretending never to have seen them before. 
.l1
.i10
"My lord, as you can see, we are a poor country. 
King Hengist wrung every last drop of wealth from us. 
Now we are destitute." 
,"There can be no doubt that Hengist was not wise in the ways of wealth", Arthur began, "but I am sure that your
country can afford its fair contribution to the treasury at Camelot. 
After all, if I am to accept the responsibility as your liege to defend you from all attackers, you must surely
be able to defray my costs. 
I must agree, however, that you do seem quite impoverished." 
,"The documents make that clear, my lord." 
,"You do seem to be missing something, though. 
Where is the long parchment dating from two years ago?" 
,"My lord? Long parchment?", the minister said, trying to sound confused instead of stunned. 
,"The long parchment with the creased upper right corner listing possessions in the southeast part of the
kingdom." 
.l1
.i0
Panic grew in the noble's eyes. 
Arthur could not possibly have known about that document. 
But somehow he not only knew of its existence, but had actually seen it. 
Groping for words, he looked down at the floor in a feigned search for the missing document. 
He officiously ruffled through piles of old documents on the shelves. 
Then he stooped down under the table, loudly musing that perhaps it fell under the table. 
Sure enough, he emerged a moment later grasping the missing document, wondering how such an important document
could have been allowed to fall, remonstrating against his own carelessness. 
Arthur smiled knowingly and thanked him. 
That little visit with Merlin had been more valuable than he had suspected. 
.l1
.i10
"This indicates that the kingdom can afford a good deal more in tithes. 
Yes, a good deal more. 
Very well, I have made up my mind." 
.l1
.i0
Back in the throne room, Arthur announced his findings. 
.l1
.i10
"Your kingdom has been struggling under the burden of too large a military budget for too long. 
My protection will relieve you of that burden. 
Henceforth, you will maintain only eight men-at-arms. 
You will send me a tithe of ten pieces of gold per week. 
This will reduce your overall taxation and allow you to prosper. 
However, as you prosper, so will I. 
I will be back to increase the tithes every year. 
Fare ye well." 



.BTHE GREAT WAR
.p
Penda made the opening move. 
He marched on Horsa in an attempt to destroy some of Arthur's economic strength and discredit Arthur as a
liege. 
It was a serious threat, for if Penda were successful in pillaging Horsa's land, Horsa would undoubtedly
reconsider the wisdom of accepting Arthur as his liege. 
He would not renounce Arthur as his liege and re-assert his independence, for such a vile act would earn the
scorn of the kings of Britain. 
But he could and very well might seek a new liege, a liege who could effectively protect him from marauding
enemies. 
Therefore, when Arthur became aware that Penda was marching toward Horsa's kingdom, he wasted no time. 
He instantly gathered his knights and marched for Horsa's capital, hoping to beat Penda there. 
He was successful; his army arrived at Horsa's castle a full two weeks before Penda's. 
There he waited, congratulating himself on the trap he had set for Penda. 
Penda expected to encounter only Horsa's own defense forces plus a small contingent of Arthur's men. 
He would be in for a brutal surprise when he found himself facing not only Horsa's army, but also Arthur's. 
Horsa and Arthur laughed together at the prospect of Penda's shock when he discovered their trap. 
.p
The two armies met at Basing, not far from Uintancaestir where Arthur had been declared king. 
Penda appeared with 40 men-at-arms and six knights. 
Arthur had brought 30 men-at-arms and seven knights; Horsa had 10 men-at-arms under his direct command. 
The two armies were thus very closely matched. 
Penda's slight disadvantage in numbers was offset by the greater experience of his men. 
.p
Arthur was in command of the biggest army of his life, in the closest battle he had ever fought. 
He knew that a great deal hung on this battle. 
If he could defeat Penda here and now, it might give him the momentum to swing Uryens. 
A victory here could win the entire island. 
A defeat could just as easily mean the loss of everything that he had been building for the last year. 
The army could well be destroyed on this battlefield, as it had been destroyed in its last encounter with Penda. 
There was also the chance that knights might die on this battlefield. 
And finally, there was the possibility that Arthur himself would die on this day. 
.p
Arthur laid his plan of battle carefully. 
He had two more knights than Penda; he would use that advantage. 
Galahad was put on the extreme left flank, with Horsa on the extreme right flank. 
Each commander would swing around the flank of the enemy and cut in behind them. 
Arthur's hope was that, by concentrating his strength on the flanks, he would be able to roll up Penda's army and
trap Penda himself in the center. 
Of course, Penda would have a relative advantage in the center and would press Arthur very hard there. 
Arthur would simply have to hold out. 
To make this plan work even better, he raked his flanks forward, setting himself further back from Penda. 
This would insure that the battle would begin on the flanks, where he had the advantage. 
It would give him a little more time before Penda struck him. 
.p
The battle began with the traditional peasant charge. 
There were many peasants on hand, and they fought furiously. 
But Penda's men were all seasoned veterans; they disposed of the peasants smoothly and efficiently. 
Only two of Penda's men fell to the peasant assault. 
.p
The main battle began at the flanks, exactly according to Arthur's plan. 
Galahad and Horsa did their jobs perfectly, wheeling about to take Penda's flank units from behind. 
The rest of Arthur's army joined into the battle a moment later. 
Penda's flanks were steadily chopped up under the pressure placed upon them. 
Unable to stand up to the tremendous attack, the group of men facing Galahad collapsed. 
A moment later, Horsa crushed his opponents. 
Arthur's plan was unfolding like clockwork. 
.p
But things were not going well in the center. 
Penda's men there had a clear advantage, and they were steadily cutting Arthur's men to pieces. 
Arthur's royal guard was having a hard time against Penda's royal guard. 
Outnumbered, they were dying one by one. 
Quickly, Arthur gave orders for both Galahad and Horsa to roll up Penda's line before Penda destroyed Arthur's
line. 
This they did with great energy, falling on the next units in Penda's line and doing great damage. 
But the situation in the center was deteriorating faster than their progress. 
Arthur gave desperate orders to Galahad and Horsa to desist from their attacks,
ride to his rescue and attack Penda from behind. 
This they set out to do. 
Too late, the last of Arthur's guard was killed. 
Arthur found himself alone against Penda's royal guard. 
He dashed back, looking for a refuge. 
Both Lancelot on his left and Kay on his right were in similar dire straits. 
Arthur fell back, trying to find a place to make a stand. 
At that point, Mordred raised a shout, "The king is running!" 
Mordred turned and fled the field, taking his men with him. 
Percivale tried to close the gap Mordred had opened, but Penda's men were already moving through it. 
Fortunately, this created a hole through which Galahad could make his escape. 
Horsa managed to get around the flank and back to the main army. 
At this point, everything came unglued. 
It was obvious to both sides that Arthur's plan had failed, that his army was beaten, and that Arthur himself was
in grave peril. 
Penda's men, flushed by the imminence of victory, pressed their attacks with renewed vigor. 
Arthur's men knew they were beaten but were determined to make an orderly escape. 
They managed it well, filing off the battlefield in good order, protecting themselves and each other. 
Nobody was left behind; Arthur was the last man to leave the field. 
.p
Back in Horsa's castle at Cantwaraburh, the mood was somber but not despairing. 
Only one knight, Sir Kay, had died in the battle. 
Although the loss of his brother was a great personal loss to Arthur, it did not cripple the army. 
Eight men-at-arms had died in the fighting. 
By contrast, they had killed two of Penda's knights and ten of his men. 
By this measurement, they had won the battle, or at least should have won. 
Only the collapse of the center had robbed them of the victory they otherwise deserved. 
They were ready for the next battle; they would surely win the second battle
if Penda were foolish enough to stay. 
.p
Penda was not so foolish. 
He marched his men back to Mercia, but not for fear of Arthur. 
Penda had other problems. 
Uryens had swept down to pillage Mercia, and Penda now had to defend his homeland. 
Hearing of Penda's predicament, Arthur hurried back to Camelot to pick up fresh troops. 
Already the replacements for the eight dead men were being trained. 
Uryens reached Mercia before Penda, and pillaged Penda's land unmolested for a week. 
When Penda's main army arrived on the scene, they fought a furious battle in which both sides suffered heavy
losses. 
Uryens emerged victorious. 
A second battle soon followed, and Uryens won a clear-cut victory there. 
Penda tried one more time, and was soundly beaten. 
Upon hearing this news,
all of Arthur's knights clamored for an immediate march to Mercia to finish off Penda once and for all. 
Arthur considered his options carefully. 
Then he made a bold move that took everyone by surprise: he marched his army far to the north, all the way to
Uryen's kingdom. 
It took four weeks. 
Arthur knew that neither Uryens nor Penda would hear of his move until several weeks after he had arrived in
Dalriada. 
Messengers travelled little faster than armies. 
This would give Arthur time to pillage Dalriada with impunity before Uryens returned. 
He looted and pillaged the land for three weeks before setting off for Camelot. 
Arthur's calculations proved correct. 
Uryens, caught off guard by his unexpected maneuver, hurried home but just missed Arthur's army. 
Arthur returned home with pillage and with his prestige somewhat recovered from the blow it had taken after
his second defeat to Penda. 
.BINTRODUCTION
.p
EXCALIBUR is a very different sort of computer game. 
EXCALIBUR creates an entire world of fantasy based on the legend of King Arthur. 
Unlike the legends, though, YOU are King Arthur, and you make the legend come alive with your own actions. 
.p
What makes EXCALIBUR so different from other computer games is its size and scope. 
We have created a world that includes economics, diplomacy, magic, wars and battles, friendship, loyalty,
and treachery, to name just a few things. 
.P
How can we tell you about all the things we built into this world? 
We could, of course, list all of the formulas and algorithms that make it go, but that would ruin the fantasy for
you. 
So instead, we have done two things. 
First, we tried very hard to make the game so real that you could use your intuition rather than our formulas. 
Second, we have written an entire novel just to help you become familiar with the feel of the world we have
created. 
Read this novel very carefully; it tells you all about the world of EXCALIBUR. 
You will probably re-read the novel several times just to brush up on the finer points of the way the world
works. 
To help you with the computer, we have also provided a reference that summarizes the commands available. 
.p
We did not design this game for the casual player. 
There are thousands of candy-games for people who like a quick thrill. 
This game demands more of the player and gives more in return. 
It will take you a long time to truly understand the world of EXCALIBUR. 
Please don't get frustrated in the meantime---the world we have created does make sense (at least, it makes sense
to us). 
Enjoy the process of discovery that we encourage with this game.
