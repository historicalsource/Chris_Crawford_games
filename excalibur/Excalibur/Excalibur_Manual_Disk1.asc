.P
The first task facing Arthur on his return was the rebuilding of the army. 
A new attack on the scale of the last one would surely prove too much for his men to handle. 
It was also not lost on Arthur that, had his army been a little larger at the outset, he might well have driven
Hengist away at the first battle. 
Arthur therefore resolved to build an army of fifteen men-at-arms. 
At Merlin's urging, though, he raised the army slowly, always keeping the budget for the army just one gold piece
more than was necessary to sustain the existing army. 
This, Merlin assured him, was the thriftiest way to expand the army. 
It was slower, but it wasted no money. 
Attempts to raise the size of the army quickly required huge amounts of money, according to Merlin. 
.p
Meanwhile, messengers poured into Camelot with tales of war all over the island. 
Hengist's attack on Arthur had precipitated a series of campaigns. 
Pellinore, who deeply hated Hengist, had taken advantage of Hengist's absence from Lundenwic to pillage Hengist's
own kingdom. 
Uryens thereupon attacked Pellinore. 
Augusel campaigned on Lot. 
Penda attacked Horsa. 
It was a bewildering collection of stories that confronted the young king. 
.l1
.i10
"Merlin, tell me, what does all of this mean? 
Why are all of these kings attacking each other? 
And what course should I take?" 
,"It is a complex course of events that is taking shape now, my king. 
All the old rivalries, the ancient hatreds and alliances, are coming back to us now. 
I fear now that the kings of Britain will all contest with each other for rule of the island. 
I had hoped you would have more time to prepare before your test came, but they will not allow you that. 
Gird yourself for more battle, Arthur. 
In the coming months you may have to defend yourself yet again." 
.l1
.i0
A trumpet played a fanfare in the throne room. 
.l1
.i10
"Another messenger! 
What new confounding tales has he for us? 
What new twists and turns will this situation take?" 
.l1
.i0
But there was no messenger waiting for Arthur when he entered the throne room. 
Instead, a knight stood waiting before the throne. 
As Arthur entered the room, he knelt. 
.l1
.i10
"Greetings, Sir Knight. 
What journey brings you through Camelot?" 
,"This is not a way-station for me, my lord---it is my destination. 
I have come from far Luel to offer my sword to you as rightful king of all Britain." 
,"What is your name, Sir Knight?" 
,"I am Gawain, my lord." 
,"Luel is in the domain of King Baldulf. 
Why do you offer your sword to an alien king?" 
,"My lord, I seek to win riches and glory by proving my worthiness as a knight. 
King Baldulf cares not for the skills of a great knight. 
He is a weakling of a king; the men laugh at him behind his back. 
I felt shame at being in his service. 
So I have come to Camelot in search of a king who will use my skills." 

,"You will have ample opportunity to show your talents, Sir Gawain. 
Welcome to Camelot. 
Take a place with my other knights at the Round Table." 
.i0
.l1
They feasted in honor of Sir Gawain that night. 
Gawain told of his early knighthood, how he had fought against barbarians in Gaul, and how he came to return to
Britain. 
A mighty warrior and a good storyteller, Gawain awed and charmed all who listened. 
All the knights of the Round Table saluted him, and welcomed him as their comrade and brother. 
.l2
.c******************
.l2
Weeks passed. 
More messengers arrived, each bringing shocking and sad tales of mayhem, battle, and death. 
Kings were on the march everywhere. 
It seemed that the entire island was on fire. 
What was worse, there seemed to be no pattern to the wars being fought. 
Arthur built his army even larger, to eighteen men-at-arms. 
This put a strain on his little kingdom, so recently ravaged by Hengist, but Arthur judged it better than risking
another destructive invasion. 
As his men trained, Arthur paced and planned, trying to analyze the events of the last months. 
.l1
.i10
"Merlin, why do the kings fight the way they do? 
Why does Augusel fight Uryens? 
Why did Penda attack Horsa, when other enemies were nearer at hand? 
Why even did Hengist attack me?" 
,"It is all part of a larger picture, a long story that stretches back far into the past, before your father. 
When the Romans left Britain, they left behind no one king to rule. 
A host of minor kings, dukes, and even single knights set up small countries as best they could. 
Without a strong king to unite them, they fought among themselves. 
Meanwhile, the Saxons were attacking all along the eastern coast. 
Soon the Saxons, realizing there would be no resistance, began occupying the lands that they once only pillaged. 
Even then there was no unification, no king to resist them. 
And their kingdoms grew at the expense of the Celtic lands. 
Then your father, Uther Pendragon, came. 
He was a strong leader and a mighty warrior. 
He fought tirelessly, incessantly, against Celt and Saxon alike, conquering all. 
For twenty years he raged up and down the island, fighting battles all the way. 
He managed to beat down all opposition and reduce all of his enemies to vassalage, but his grip on them was
precarious. 
He was successful in destroying the smaller dukedoms, but many of his stronger opponents were not beaten, but
merely reduced to a state of sullen vassalage, waiting only for the chance to revolt. 
Many were the times they thought their chance had come, only to be proven wrong. 
I still can't believe some of the narrow escapes your father had," Merlin chuckled wistfully. 
"How many times his enemies thought they had him at last, and how many times he confounded them. 
That man had a charmed life." 
Merlin winked at Arthur. 
"Of course, I had something to do with a few of those miraculous escapes. 
But the shame of it all was that it was so unnecessary. 
If Uther had only tried a more conciliatory policy and demanded lower tithes,
he might have cooled the flames of rebellion and eliminated
resistance to his authority. 
But no, he kept saying that he found corpses far more reasonable than living rebels. 
And so he fought on, always winning, never succeeding, until the day he died. 
On that day his enemies rejoiced, and they all came forward to lay claim to their ancient kingdoms. 
Saxons in the east, Celts in the west, all scrambled to carve up Uther's empire. 
The wars that were fought on his death were terrible. 
The island was bled white, and the people suffered horribly. 
Nobody won any of those wars. 
Many lost; they managed to narrow it down to fifteen contenders. 
But mutual exhaustion set in. 
Nobody had the strength to fight. 
A truce was called, and it eventually grew into a general peace. 
Mind you, nobody agreed to the general peace; nobody had the strength to start a new war. 
And so things have stood for the last twenty years, while you, Arthur, grew to manhood. 
The other kings have grown old and settled. 
Some of them have died, and new, more foolish ones have taken their places. 
But for twenty years no one dared break the informal truce, until Hengist attacked you. 
Armies had withered and wasted as kings concentrated on rebuilding the shattered land. 
But now a new round of warfare looms, and soon the blood will flow. 
Every king knows this, and every king all over the land is building his armies. 
,"Every single king? 
How can you know this to be true, Merlin?" 
,"Because I have seen it with my own eyes. 
I have been inside the castles of the other kings, and I have seen their doings." 
,"Show me, Merlin. 
Let me see the castles of the other kings." 
,"Whose castle would you see?" 
,"Let me see my enemy Hengist." 
,"Very well, it is done." 
,"What do you mean? 
Nothing has changed. 
We are still here in your room in Camelot." 
,"Think ye so, King Arthur? 
Come inspect your treasury room." 
.l1
.i0
Arthur complied. 
Opening the door, he stepped into the treasury room, and immediately noticed that something was wrong. 
Bending over the treasure chest, he looked inside. 
.l1
.i10
"Merlin, a thief has made off with at least a hundred pieces of gold!" 
,"No, my king, for it is not your gold to start with." 
.l1
.i0
The door to the room opened and in stepped---Hengist! 
Arthur shouted for the guards, but Hengist seemed completely unaware of either Arthur or Merlin. 
Muttering to himself, he ruffled through some parchments, found the document he sought, and left. 
.l1
.i10
"You see?" asked Merlin. 
"We are in the castle of King Hengist, as spirits. 
We are invisible to all eyes. 
We move in perfect safety." 
,"Your magic has fooled me again, Merlin. 
Of what use is this game?" 
,"You are the one who wanted to visit Hengist. 
What do you want to learn here?" 
,"Let us at least determine what we can of his army. 
Let's see...."
.l1
.i0
Arthur began rummaging through the parchments in the room. 
.l1
.i10
"He obviously doesn't have much in his treasury. 
Here's why: his taxes are...thirty pieces of gold per week. 
And his army is...um...also thirty pieces of gold per week. 
No wonder his treasury is so small! 
And no wonder that his people are so oppressed! 
He taxes them heavily to support a huge army. 
Very interesting!" 
,"There is more, young king. 
Let us move to the throne room." 
.l1
.i0
Through the narrow door into the throne room they went, and what Arthur saw was unlike Camelot. 
.l1
.i10
"Where is the map table?", he asked Merlin. 
,"That is something I built for you;
no other king has anything like it." 
,"What is this that I see? 
What are all these crowns?" 
,"This is an illusion that I have created for your benefit. 
All the crowns of all the kings of Britain are shown here. 
The position of each crown shows how Hengist feels about that king. 
See, there is the crown labelled 'Arthur'. 
See how far to the left it is? 
That is because Hengist hates you. 
So, too, does he hate Pellinore who pillaged his land while you were gone. 
Indeed, Hengist seems to dislike almost every other king in Britain. 
Only towards Uryens and Penda does he seem mildly disposed. 
This Hengist is definitely a vile man." 
,"Verily, Merlin. 
He must have few friends." 
,"Indeed so, a fact of which you may someday take good advantage. 
Come, let us spy on his feasting room." 
.i0
.l1
They moved on into the large dining hall. 
In size and shape it was similar to the Round Table Room in Camelot. 
There was even a large table in the center of the room. 
Hengist was seated at the table, conversing with a fair young damsel, a glint in his eye. 
His queen Malmagest sat quietly nearby, ignoring the flirtation. 
The various knights stood about, boasting, eating and drinking. 
.l1
.i10
,"What is the point of this observation, Merlin? 
What care I for Hengist's tastes, either in food or women?" 
,"Will you not learn to see even the most obvious facts? 
Where is Hengist?" 
,"Why, he's right in front of us, you old fool!" 
,"And if he is right in front of us, where is he not?" 
,"Where is he NOT?!?!?" 
.l1
.i0
Arthur's exasperation was getting the better of him. 
He kicked at a stool, collapsing it. 
The knight who was sitting on it fell hard on his rump. 
The drunken knight looked around angrily, and seeing no one, shrugged his shoulders and shuffled off. 
.l1
.i10
,"He's NOT in his throne room, he's NOT in his treasury room, he's NOT in his tower room." 
,"Yes, go on. 
Where else is he not?" 
.i0
.l1
Arthur's rage was unbounded. 
He began shouting, screaming, and stomping about. 
.l1
.i10
,"He's NOT in the courtyard, he's NOT in the fields, he's NOT in Cantware, he's NOT in Mercia, he's NOT in
Camelot...."
.l1
.i0
Arthur stopped his pacing. 
He stared at the wall, thinking furiously. 
Slowly he turned towards Merlin. 
.l1
.i10
"Oh. 
I see now." 
,"Bright lad, I knew you had it in you." 
,"So if I come to this room, and Hengist is gone, that means that he has gone on campaign?" 
,"Indeed so. 
You will see only those knights whom he left behind to defend the castle." 
,"How will I know where he has gone?" 
,"You will see the name of his victim on yonder wall." 
,"How utterly convenient!" 
,"I always aim to please, my lord. 
Shall we return?" 
,"Verily, magnificent mage." 
,"Indeed so, greatest of kings. 
After you!" 
.l1
.i0
Back through the false Merlin's room they pranced, laughing and joking. 
With the twinkle of an eye, they were
back in Merlin's room in Camelot. 
.l1
.i10
"That is wonderful magic, Merlin", Arthur began. 
"Let us visit all the castles of all the kings." 
,"That might strain my magic too much for one day. 
I have a better way. 
Let us take a walk through the forest, and I shall tell you about the kings of Britain." 
.l1
.i0
They set off, Merlin leading the way. 
Soon they were deep in the forest, far from any roads, trails, or people. 
.l1
.i10
,"Tell me now, Merlin. 
Tell me about the kings of Britain." 
,"Very well, then. 
I shall begin with Augusel, king of Pictland in the far north. 
.p
"Augusel is a strong king ruling a weak kingdom. 
Pictland has never been a wealthy land, and Augusel's ambitions exceed his kingdom's capacities. 
He is an excitable man who will respond to adversity with fury, and to warmth with surprising charity. 
He fears nothing, and treats his vassals with fairness and consideration. 
He is a poor commander, not known for military prowess. 
This is a man of many contrasts. 
He loves Garwin, Baldulf, Colgrin, Idres, and Lot, but for Uryens, his closest neighbor, he feels but mild love. 
For his part, Uryens hates Augusel. 
Augusel's hate is reserved for Hengist, Horsa, and Royns, but most particularly for Hoel. 
To you, Arthur, Augusel is indifferent. 
.p
"Uryens, king of Dalriada, is a Celt like Augusel. 
Uryens is an apprehensive king, deeply concerned about his position. 
He sees plots and attacks where there are none, and suspects all those around him. 
He will go to any lengths to achieve the security he craves. 
He is an excellent battlefield commander. 
He dislikes his neighbors Augusel, Lot, and Idres, suspecting them of conspiracies against him. 
He is not a friendly man; Hoel is the only king whom he greatly likes. 
Yet, Hoel finds him unpleasant. 
For you, Arthur, he feels no special hatred; you are the recipient of only Uryens' normal supply of dislike. 
His greatest hate is reserved for Hengist. 
.p
"Lot is king of Lleudiniawn. 
He created his kingdom out of the lands of Reget and Beornice many years ago. 
He would very much like to expand his kingdom, but his earlier wars have exhausted the wealth of the kingdom. 
Lot is an aggressive king; he will surely attack his neighbors as soon as he gets the opportunity. 
The most likely objects of an attack are Royns, Hoel, and Baldulf. 
Fortunately for them, Lot is an utterly inept tactician; he will probably lose all of his battles. 
Lot may well form a pact with his good friend Idres. 
.p
"Idres rules Reget. 
He is the son of the mighty Bagdemagus. 
In the wars following the death of Uther Pendragon, Bagdemagus conquered the entire northern part of the island. 
He then set out to conquer the remainder of Britain. 
But then Augusel led the wild Picts of the north in a revolt against Bagdemagus. 
When Bagdemagus proved unable to quell the revolt, Uryens, a duke under Bagdemagus, declared himself king
and made war on Bagdemagus. 
At this point, Lot, an ambitious duke of northern Boernice, offered to help reconquer the north if Bagdemagus
would recognize him as king of a small portion. 
Bagdemagus agreed, and Lot, who was at the time a mighty warrior,
energetically conquered much of his old kingdom, keeping most of it for himself. 
Only Reget remaind his. 
At this point, Bagdemagus died under very mysterious circumstances; his
weakling son Idres inherited the kingdom. 
Idres now resents Lot and Uryens, but has come to good terms with Augusel. 
He rejects the ways of his father and seeks to guarantee peace for his kingdom. 
The army and knights that he inherited from his father are magnificent. 
Man for man, they can defeat any force in the country. 
You will be pleased to know that Idres is very well-disposed towards you; he sympathizes with you as a kindred
orphan and looks up to you as a king who can unify Britain without another long series of wars. 
.p
"Beornice is the land ruled by Colgrin, who came here from the mainland and conquered it not long after Uther
Pendragon died. 
Colgrin is a charismatic king driven by his ambition. 
He would rule the entire island, and will gladly spill rivers of blood to do so. 
He is kindly disposed towards Horsa and Royns, but hates Lot, who stole several counties from his kingdom. 
His hatred for Lot has driven him into intrigues with Idres, whom he hopes will attack Lot. 
His greatest enemy, however, is Hengist. 
They were rivals on the mainland;
they fought the Huns together, but Hengist betrayed Colgrin and his army was destroyed. 
They both were forced to flee the fury of the Huns and came to Britain with their followers seeking to build
a new life. 
Colgrin has sworn revenge against Hengist. 
.p
"Baldulf is a minor Saxon king who came to Britain long ago. 
He was defeated by Uther Pendragon and accepted Uther as his liege. 
When Uther died, Baldulf enlarged his kingdom at the expense of several neighboring kings. 
However, he has settled down now and seems content with his holdings. 
His kingdom, called Elmet, is in a wild and mountainous area. 
His strongest feelings are for his Saxon and Angle kin. 
His hatred for Hengist is unbounded, while he holds Horsa and Cheldric in very high esteem. 
His army is very devoted to the old man even though his military sense is starting to slip. 
.p
"Garwin is king of Powys. 
The son of another of Uther's vassals, Garwin also seeks not the flames of war. 
But woe to the king who attacks Garwin! 
His army is excellent, and he is a very clever commander. 
Moreover, the lust for revenge holds
the place in Garwin's heart that ambition holds in the hearts of other kings. 
Methinks, though, that if Garwin is soundly beaten, he will accept his defeat in good graces and readily
become vassal. 
Like many of the other Saxon kings, Garwin hates Hengist and Lot. 
.p
"Sater is king of Deira. 
He is a small-headed man, with eyes set too close together. 
There is much meanness in Sater; 
he will fight wars for spite alone. 
He hates and fears Colgrin, who took land away from him. 
For this reason he supports Lot, Colgrin's enemy. 
He also likes Hoel and Uryens---I know not why. 
Beware this king--he is most dangerous. 
.p
"Penda is the powerful ruler of Mercia. 
He is the only Celtic ruler to successfully resist the foreign invaders. 
The other Celtic kings have retained their independence mostly through distance from the invaders. 
Penda has faced them and defeated them in battle over and over again. 
His constant wars have inured him well. 
He trusts and likes no other king; yet neither does he deeply hate any, save of course the universally
detested Hengist. 
.p
"King Pellinore of Gwynedd may be one of your best friends. 
He holds you in very high esteem as the man to restore Celtic rule to Britain. 
He himself does not wish to undertake the task, for he does not see himself as a mighty warrior, even though
in truth his army is a very competent force. 
Of his neighbors, he has established a very positive relationship with his Celtic cousin Royns. 
He dislikes the Saxon Garwin and detests Baldulf. 
Despite this, Pellinore is a man of generous disposition not given to violent fits of ill-temper. 
.p
"Cheldric, king of East Engle, is the least viscious of the Angle-Saxon invaders. 
A refugee from the Huns, he came here with no grand plans of conquest. 
He will strike his enemies, but he will not initiate a war. 
He feels great affinity for his fellow Germanic tribes, even Hengist. 
Although his heart is not so warm toward Celts, he cannot be said to hate them. 
His peaceful ways are reflected in his army, whose greatest utility is ceremonial. 
.p
"And now I come to Hengist, king of Lundenwic, the most hated man in Britain. 
It is hard to imagine how a man could cultivate such universal emnity, but Hengist has succeeded by dint of
tireless evil-doing. 
His ambition is boundless, his charity unknown, his capacity for evil beyond measure. 
He seems to hate the other kings almost as much as they hate him. 
Only Cheldric and Lot have won his esteem, perhaps because Lot is traitor to Colgrin and Cheldric is
so generous. 
.p
"Horsa is Hengist's brother, although one could not tell it from their behavior. 
It seems that Hengist even betrayed Horsa at one time, so now their relationship is one of mutual distrust. 
Horsa is not as evil as Hengist, but he still possesses many of the traits of his Angle brothers. 
He has an ugly side that shows when he is crossed, and can be very stubborn indeed. 
He hates Hoel only; otherwise, he is  disposed to leave kings alone. 
.p
"Royns is typical of the Celtic kings before Uther, although Royns was not king during Uther's time. 
He has an aversion to warfare, but will fight if need be. 
He would just as soon be vassal as king, if only a true king could be found. 
He leads a potent army but would rather not use it. 
He feels great affection for his uncle Hoel, but for some reason his affection has not been transferred to you. 
.p
"Lastly comes Hoel, king of Domnonia, and your father-in-law. 
Hoel is a tired old king. 
He is weary of battle and seeks to solve all of his problems with a smile and a charitable disposition. 
Such attitudes might have worked in the days when all Britain was Celtic, but now, Hoel survives only because
your kingdom lies between Hoel and the world. 
Hoel is a weakling and will surely become a vassal if he does not die first. 
.p
"Those are the kings of Britain, their stories and characters. 
Now that I have told you about them, you can visit each castle in turn and carefully consider all that I have
told you. 
Is this all clear to you?" 
.l1
.i0
Arthur was asleep. 
.l1
.c***********
.l1
.i10
"Welcome, Sir Lancelot. 
We all know of your many exploits. 
We are honored to have such a famous knight visit us." 
,"I come not to visit but to petition for admission to the noble comradeship of the Round Table. 
Far and wide have I searched to find a cause worthy of my sword;
glad is my heart that I find in Arthur a king whose cause is just. 
I offer you my sword in your service." 
,"I cannot offer you the wealth and trappings to which a knight such as yourself must be accustomed. 
I can only offer you a position of honor at the Round Table. 
Is this acceptable to you?" 
,"Most acceptable, my lord, for I care not for material possessions. 
I seek only the honor that I may earn with my sword." 
,"Nobly spoken, Sir Lancelot. 
Join us. 
Let us hold a great feast in honor of Lancelot, our newest and greatest comrade." 
.l1
.i0
.p
He stood up to go but was stopped by one of the court advisors. 
.l1
.i10
"Excuse me, sire, but there is also a messenger here for you." 
,"Oh, really?
Where is he?" 
,In yon corner, my lord. 
He has been waiting very quietly since midday." 
.l1
.i10
Arthur turned in the direction indicated. 
The people along his line of sight parted to reveal, cowering in the corner, the same messenger who had brought
Hengist's first message. 
.l1
.i10
"You again?" Arthur asked. 
.l1
.i0
The man nodded slowly, saying nothing. 
Although his presence spelled very bad news for Arthur, he couldn't help but smile at the poor man's terror. 
.l1
.i10
"I assume you bring a similar message to me." 
.l1
.i0
The man stepped forward a few feet from the corner and fell to his knees. 
.l1
.i10
"Yes, most noble King Arthur, victor of Wodnes Beorg, wielder..." 
,"Yes, yes, I know. 
And your master sends his usual courtesies?" 
,"Um...my lord...", the messenger stammered, not taking Arthur's meaning. 
,"You go tell your master, the illustrious King Hengist, that Arthur sends him warmest greetings and
looks forward eagerly to the day when they may embrace again, and that Excalibur is also eager for that day." 
.l1
.i0
The messenger stifled a groan. 
A new burden to bear, a new risk to take. 
Messengering was much more secure when kings merely exchanged simple pleasantries and idle gossip. 
.l1
.i10
"Yes, my lord." 
.l1
.i0
The messenger scuttled out on his new mission. 
Arthur stood up and addressed the assemblage. 
.l1
.i10
"King Hengist marches on us again. 
His army is bigger than it was last time. 
But this time, we are ready for him. 
We shall drive him out on the first battle." 

.BTHE NEW KING
.p
Necks craned. 
A jumble of voices assaulted the ear. 
Fingers pointed down the road. 
Occasional shrieks of laughter rent the air. 
The peasants milled about in the open space that served as the entry road to the castle of Camelot. 
.l1
.i10
.d
"Can you see him yet?" 
"Yes!"
"No!"
"Use your own eyes!"
"There he is!"
"No, that's just a pennant!"
.i0
.d0
.p
At the far end of the ragged group of thatched huts lining the road, a horseman appeared. 
His horse, large and powerful, fidgeted as the rider urged him forward. 
After a few uncertain sidesteps, the horse obeyed the man, and stepped forward. 
.l1
.i10
.d
"That's him! King Arthur!"
"Hooray for King Harter! Hooray for King Harter!"
"That's Arthur, stupid!"
"He certainly looks young to me. How could he have pulled that sword out of that rock?"
"Because he's the rightful king of all Britain.  Excalibur will only obey him."
"Sounds to me like some sort of shenanigan."
"Hooray for the King! Hooray for King Arthur!"
.i0
.d0
.p
Arthur rode slowly through the crowd of peasants, trying to smile to them while maintaining what
he thought to be the appropriate regal aloofness. 
Behind him were a few men-at-arms who had accompanied him from the church at Uintancaestir. 
Ahead of him lay the drawbridge of Camelot, and inside he could discern squires and servants clapping and
hurrah-ing. 
The mighty horse quickened to a trot as it crossed the drawbridge, and he was inside the courtyard. 
Dismounting, he strode toward the main door, pushed past the excited stableboys, and entered the building. 
.p
He was in the main eating hall. 
A large round table dominated the hall. 
The room was full of people, mostly servants, all staring at him. 
As if by command, they fell on their knees. 
Six knights remained standing next to the Round Table: Sir Drofwarc, Sir Nosnikta, Sir Sremmus,
Sir Lucas, Sir Lamerok, and Arthur's
brother Sir Kay. 
As Arthur approached, each in turn dropped to one knee momentarily and saluted him, "My Lord". 
Arthur acknowledged each and moved on to the next room. 
.p
This second room was smaller than the Round Table room, but much more imposing. 
At one end of the room stood an elevated throne. 
It was a simple throne, carved out of solid oak and boasting no decoration, but its massiveness and solidity
bespoke quiet, self-assured authority. 
Arthur ran his finger along the arm, feeling the grain of the wood. 
.p
In the center of the room stood a table; onto its surface had been carved a map of Britain. 
Here were shown the sixteen kingdoms and the sixteen kings who ruled them. 
There was Camelot, in the south, and next to it, in bright new lettering,
the caption:
.l1
.i20
.w60
"Arthur, wielder of Excalibur, sword of kings, and rightful king of all Britain"
.i0
.w78
.l1
.p
On to the next room. 
This room, also empty of people, was quite
small and held nothing more than a large chest and piles of parchment on a table. 
Examining them closely, he saw that they contained lists of numbers, many numbers. 
There were names of people, each one followed by entries detailing numbers of pigs and cows, bushels of grain,
and acres of land. 
"Pigs and cows?!?", he muttered. 
"Why would anybody..." 
He broke off as his eyes fell again on the chest. 
"Taxes!" he exclaimed. 
Looking about furtively, he examined the chest. 
It was secured by a huge rusty lock. 
He scanned the room for the key, but it was nowhere to be found. 
He tried to heft the chest, but it was much too heavy, and when he dropped it an enticing ring of coins sounded
from inside. 
There was a great deal of money inside. 
Embarrassed by the noise he had made, he backed off. 
Perhaps it would be better to wait for the key to turn up. 
He went to the next room. 
.p
He entered the next room cautiously, for it was quite dark inside. 
At first, he thought it was empty, for he could see nothing. 
But as his eyes adjusted to the darkness he began to recognize strange shapes, odd contraptions, and piles of
books. 
With a start, he realized that someone else was in the room, watching him. 
.i10
.l1
"Who are you?", he demanded. 
,"I am Merlin. And you are Arthur." 
,"That I am, and more. I am your king." 
,"Even more---you are king of all Britain, a fact in
which I take both pleasure and pride, for it was my magic that
allowed Uther Pendragon to lay with Igraine and beget you."
,"My father was Uther Pendragon?"
,"Even as your mother was Igraine, wife of the Duke of Domnonia."
.l1
.i0
.p
Arthur was dumbfounded. 
He had heard the tales of Uther Pendragon, the last king to rule all Britain. 
But he had never dreamed that he was Uther's heir. 
He knew he was an orphan, and was just coming to accept his new kingship without questioning its cause,
but this explained everything. 
He stepped backward, uneasy, then sat down heavily on the bare floor. 
He thought for several moments, trying to adjust to this revelation. 
.d
.i10
.l1
"Merlin, tell me, what kind of man was my father?"
.d0
"Your father was a great warrior, and a good general, but a poor king. 
He never understood the difference between the sword and the scepter. 
Long and futilely did I tell him that the Muse of Peace doth demand as much homage as the God of War. 
The delicate and subtle ways of peace taxed his patience. 
And when his patience was expended, he always had his ready solution: the sword. 
Ah, yes, he was good at it---he never lost a battle. 
But neither did he accomplish anything. 
He conquered all Britain without unifying it. 
His conquests fell apart within months of his death. 
His lifework lies forgotten and half-covered in dust. 
I tried so hard with him, but I failed. "
.i0
.l1
.p
Merlin's voice lowered, and he stared into a tiny brazier for a long time. 
Then he turned to Arthur. 
His face illuminated from the eerie glow of the coals, he spoke slowly and carefully:
.l1
.i10
"You must finish what your father could not. 
You must unify the land. 
You must bring all the warring nations together under your rule, as king of all Britain."
,"And how am I to do that? 
I am not the general my father was. 
My kingdom is not the strongest kingdom in the land. 
My army is ridiculously small. 
What chance have I?"
,"Ah, young one, you have so much to learn. 
Show me thy sword". 
.l1
.i0
Arthur drew Excalibur. 
He was stunned to see that it glowed faintly in the dark room, emitting a color that changed from
green to blue to pink so rapidly that his eyes could not at first take in the color. 
.l1
.i10
"What is this sorcery that you are doing to my sword?", he demanded. 
,"I am doing nothing. 
Excalibur is no ordinary sword. 
It still glows from the thundering fires that forged it many centuries ago in the heart of the earth. 
From it you can feel the power that lies so calmly within the earth. 
It is the sword of kings, and so long as you are true to your kingly ideals, it will serve you and you alone. 
Can you feel the power within it?" 
,"Yes....yes, I can. 
It...it feels very heavy." 
,"It is heavy, indeed so---heavy with power. 
That is why no other man could lift it from the stone. 
The stone did not hold it tightly. 
It was the weight of the sword that held it in place. 
Only you, Arthur, the true king, can lift it, for only you are blessed with the capacity to wield power. 
When you are a wiser king, you will find Excalibur to be as light as a feather. 
Do you see now why you can indeed overcome the obstacles that face you?" 
,"Yes, but one sword cannot conquer Britain." 
,"Conquest! 
It is a vile game, easy to learn but impossible to master, and ultimately pointless. 
That was the lesson your father never learned. 
You must not make that mistake. 
Remember, you have many other possibilities." 
,"How do you know? 
Who are you to say all these things?" 
,"I am Merlin, a magician." 
,"What manner of man are you, Merlin, to say such things?" 
,"I am no manner of man. 
I am oak, and rock, and air. 
I am an illusion, a voice of the meadows, forests, and hills. 
The contentions and fractiousness of men puts a dissonance into the gentle harmony of the land. 
I am here to help restore the quiet song of this island." 
,"How will you do that?" 
,"I will advise and guide you. 
And, should my advice be insufficient, I can also work my magic. 
I can do much for you: I can bring pestilence down on the land of your enemies to ruin their crops,
or I can rain foul plague down on their armies. 
I can let you see their innermost secrets; I can even change their hearts towards you. 
But my powers are not limitless. 
The exercise of my magic will surely wear me away, even as the bearing of infants doth wear away the mother, or
the plucking of the rose doth weaken the bush. 
You must use my powers with restraint. "
,"How do I use your powers?"
,"All in good time, young one. 
But more important duties call. 
Your people await you. 
You must not disappoint them." 
.i0
.l1
.p
Merlin opened the door, flooding the room with what now looked like blinding light. 
Arthur followed him out. 
.i10
.l1
"This is the treasury room. 
From this room you will make the important decisions that govern your people's wealth. 
Here you impose taxes to raise income. 
The wealth you thereby gather can be spent to raise an army of men-at-arms. 
Or you can save it, and build up a large treasure chest. 
Or you can have no taxes at all."
,"What?!  No taxes? 
Do you really think I would be such a fool as to forswear my right as king to levy any tax I so choose?"
,"No, I don't think that you are that kind of fool. 
You are the kind of fool who would destroy his own taxes." 
,"What do you mean by that? 
If I am king, I can declare any tax I so desire. 
Neither you nor any man can stop me."
,"You cannot tax what isn't there. 
The kingdom has only so much money to give. 
You cannot take more and you should not even take most. 
You should leave some for the kingdom."
,"And why should I?"
,"So that the kingdom may grow and prosper. 
Your people are not fools. 
They do not expend their excess money on idle recreation. 
What little you leave them, they use to better themselves. 
They build barns to store their hay, fences to keep their cattle, wagons to carry their crops. 
The more you leave them, the more they will build, and with these things, they can grow ever more crops and
cattle, and grow even wealthier. 
But if you leave them nothing, they cannot build anything, and the kingdom will stagnate."
,"Very well, then, I shall not tax at all. 
They can take all the money, and they can build miles of fences and bunches of barns. 
And they shall all be rich."
,"As long as no one comes to take it away. 
What happens, King Arthur, when yon King Hengist hears of your vast wealth, with not a single man-at-arms to
defend it? 
What good be his army if he cannot use it to good profit, and what fruit could be tastier than that requiring no
exertion? 
It seems to me that old King Hengist's worst problem would be stripping the tree clean before the other kings
arrived for their share."
,"Very well, then, O Wise One, you tell me: how does the good king tax his people without hurting the
prosperity of the kingdom?"
,"With balance, my lord", said Merlin, "with balance."
.i0
.l1
.p
Merlin was already moving toward the door. 
Arthur was about to command him to explain more, but Merlin suddenly whirled around and tossed something to him. 
.i10
.l1
"Oh, yes.
You wanted this a few moments ago."
.i0
.l1
It was the key to the treasure chest. 
Arthur meekly pocketed it and hurried to catch up with Merlin. 
.l1
.i10
"This is the throne room, from which you treat with other kings. 
Here you decide the crucial affairs of international conflict. 
Here you receive messengers from far and wide, bearing news of distant events. 
Here you consider the complex web of relationships between the 16 kings of Britain. 
And here, here you declare war."
.i0
.l1
Merlin stepped over to the large map table. 
.i10
.l1
"I built this device to assist you. 
It will show you the other kings and their kingdoms. 
The color of their kingdom will tell you the king's stance toward you. 
A green kingdom is neutral---neither for you nor against you. 
A blue kingdom is your enemy. 
A pink kingdom is one upon which you have just declared war. 
A grey kingdom is your vassal. 
A purple kingdom is your tributary---that king is offering tribute to you in the hope of winning your favor and
avoiding your wrath. 
All you do is select the king and his kingdom will appear on the map;
his name and any tribute he offers you will appear here at the bottom. 
You see?" 
.i0
.l1
He moved his hand from kingdom to kingdom, illustrating his point. 
One of the sample kingdoms, though, turned a sickly brown under his call. 
Obviously chagrined, Merlin bent down, opened a small door, and poked at something inside. 
.i10
.l1
"Bah! Will I never be rid of these fiendish insects that assail my every work? 
It must be my old and worn-out tools; I must get better tools! 
There!"
.l1
.i0
Satisfied, he straightened up. 
The map now appeared to function properly. 
.i10
.l1
"That's better. 
Now, whenever messengers arrive at Camelot, they will come to this room and await your command. 
When you are ready to hear them, you signal, and one by one they will tell their tales. 
A wise king listens often and well. 
Ah, yes, I have left out a most important item---your crown. 
Here, try it on; does that not make you feel more royal? 
This is no ordinary crown. 
It will warn you of danger, of enemies coming to attack you. 
If ever you see it flash brightly, gird yourself for danger." 
.l1
.i0
Again Merlin was off before Arthur could question him. 
This time, though, he opened the door for Arthur and invited him through with a sweep of his arm. 
Arthur emerged into the large dining room with Merlin immediately behind him. 
.i10
.l1
"This, my lord, is the Round Table room. 
Here you mingle with your noble knights."
.l1
.i0
Merlin's voice and demeanor were more subservient in front of the other people. 
.l1
.i10
"My lord can while away many pleasant hours listening to the tales of valor and deeds of chivalry wrought by
the knights of the Round Table."
.i0
.l1
One of the knights stepped forward. 
.i10
.l1
"I am Sir Nosnikta", he said. 
"I shall serve you as my king with my sword and my sacred honor." 
,"Well and good, Sir Nosnikta", replied Arthur. 
"I may well need your services soon." 
.i0
.l1
The second knight approached. 
.i10
.l1
"My lord, Sir Sremmus pledges his sword to your service." 
,"I accept the pledge of such a fine knight with pleasure." 
,"My lord, my companion is Sir Drofwarc, as fine a knight as any in Britain." 
,"Greetings, Sir Drofwarc. 
You look hungry. 
Have you not partaken your fill at the Round Table?" 
,"Yes, my lord, I have; but I am always hungry. 
Eating neither sates my hunger nor increases my girth." 
,"You are both cursed and blessed, Sir Drofwarc. 
Let us hope that your blessing outlasts your curse, lest we come to be called the Round Knights of the Table." 
.i0
.l1
Sir Sremmus broke out laughing. 
Sir Drofwarc smiled in amiable embarrassment. 
Even Merlin could not erase the smirk creeping onto his face. 
This young king had a sense of humor, he thought. 
Let us hope that he can apply it to himself. 
.l1
Sir Lamerok and Sir Lucas approached the king together and knelt without saying anything. 
.i10
.l1
"Rise, good sirs. 
How came you to Camelot?" 
,"We were banished from the court of King Augusel. 
We seek a noble and fair king who is worthy of our swords. 
The wielder of Excalibur must be such a king." 
,"He shall be, fair knights."
.i0
.l1
The last knight now presented himself. 
.i10
.l1
"Ah, Kay, you need not humble yourself so. 
I am still your brother." 
,"But you are now my king, and I owe you the loyalty and deference any other knight would." 
,"Very well. 
Rise, Sir Kay." 
.i0
.l1
At this point, Merlin reclaimed Arthur, steering him over to the side of the room. 
.i10
.l1
"These are your knights, your most precious allies. 
They will fight your battles for you. 
Each one has distinguished himself in some exploit of valor. 
Each one has the fighting strength of three regular men-at-arms. 
You must treat them well and keep them happy." 
,"And how am I to know when they are unhappy?"
,"There is no easy way to see into men's hearts. 
You must watch them closely. 
See how they gather together in the hall? 
That tells a great deal. 
See how Sremmus and Drofwarc stand close by each other? 
They are good friends. 
So do Lucas and Lamerok, but a little further away; they do not feel comfortable yet. 
Sir Kay, your brother, does stand close by the Round Table out of his love for you. 
But yon Sir Nosnikta does stand too far out, at the edge of the room. 
Clearly, something troubles Nosnikta that he would stand so aloof from the Round Table. 
He cannot be trusted now while his love for you is so weak." 
,"What am I to do with him, Merlin?" 
,"You could make him a gift of gold; five pieces is the customary amount
for royal bequests. 
Mayhaps that will buy his heart. 
Or you might heap honors upon him---some new sword of honor, or perhaps a sash to wear in battle, or even a
medal. 
These things wear well on a knight, and may coax his heart towards more warmth. 
Each knight charts his own course; the honor that one craves, another disdains. 
The glitter of gold sparkles more brightly in one man's eyes than another. 
Be warned, however, that knights upon whom you bestow your
honors command a larger share of the army on the battlefield. 
You may not wish to commend many of your men to a less competent knight." 
,"But what am I to do if none of these strategems work? 
Have you not some magic spell or potion that may still the treasonous stirrings in every man's heart?" 
,"Sadly, no; I can change the heart of a king a hundred miles away but I cannot touch the heart of a knight in
the very same room. 
It has something to do with royal blood. 
Patience, I am working on it, and may have something for you someday, but for now you must rely on more
traditional methods." 
,"But what am I to do if all other methods fail? 
How do I deal with a knight whose heart is hopelessly treasonous?" 
,"In that case, you must banish the knight from your kingdom forever. 
It is a sad thing, to cast out one of your closest and most valuable men, but you must be prepared to do it if
the need arises. 
If he stays, he will subvert the loyalty of your other knights and poison your entire Round Table with the venom
in his heart. 
Such a one can only be banished." 
.i0
.l1
They were interrupted by a swelling roar arising in the courtyard. 
Of a sudden, the occupants of the Round Table room crowded toward the door, straining to see the source of the
excitement. 
Arthur moved to join the press, but was held back by Merlin. 
.i10
.l1
"Be still; you are king now. 
Whatever is happening will come to you. 
Await it with kingly dignity." 
.i0
.l1
The crowd at the door began to separate to let someone pass. 
The ripple moved through the crowd until at last Arthur could see the source of the excitement. 
A beautiful young woman emerged, led by one of the ladies-in-waiting, and halted before Arthur. 
The stranger knelt, eyes cast downward. 
.i10
.l1
"My lord", the lady-in-waiting began, "this is Gwynevere, daughter of Hoel, king of Domnonia. 
Her father has sent her to be your queen as you have agreed." 
,"Welcome, Gwynevere. 
Would you be my queen?" 
,"I will most happily do the bidding of my father."
.i0
.l1
Arthur paused, wondering at the implications of her answer. 
But there really was nothing to wonder about. 
This marriage had been arranged even before Athur's anointment at Uintancaestir. 
It added some legitimacy to his authority as king. 
It was also an excellent way to bind his kingdom to a stable, well-established one, thereby gaining a possible
ally in times of war. 
Moreover, King Hoel was getting on in years and had no male heir. 
Even if he didn't die for a long time,
he might well present his kingdom to Arthur in vassalage to relieve himself
of the burden of leading his own army in battle. 
All in all, this was a shrewd and well-planned marriage, and the reservations, pride, or insolence of one
spoiled princess were not going to ruin Arthur's plans. 
.i10
.l1
"Very well. 
We shall be married this very afternoon. 
Rise, Gwynevere. 
Go prepare thyself for the wedding." 
.i0
.l1
The wedding was held in the throne room. 
While the important personages of the kingdom looked on, the bishop of Uintancaestir, in Camelot for this duty,
joined Arthur and Gwynevere in marriage. 
Arthur gave Gwynevere a small piece of granite to symbolize his faith and constancy. 
Gwynevere gave Arthur a sprig of oak leaves to symbolize her strength and fertility. 
Then Arthur presented Queen Gwynevere to the assemblage for their approval. 
That evening, they all feasted together in the Round Table room. 
So ended Arthur's first day as king. 


.BEXCALIBUR MECHANICS
.p
The game of EXCALIBUR is exceedingly complex. 
This document explains the mechanical aspects of the game. 
It does not explain the whys and wherefors of the game; that information can be found in the novel. 
.l1
TITLE SCENE
.p
If you press the OPTION key while the title scene is in progress, the
computer will load a game previously saved. 
.l1
ROUND TABLE ROOM
.p
If you move down to the bottom of this room and keep going down, you will leave Camelot and go out into Britain. 
In the room, the positions of the knights around the Round Table indicate their social groupings. 
The distance of a knight from the center of the table indicates that knight's loyalty to Arthur. 
If you press the joystick sideways, it will change the knight currently under selection. 
You will see displayed at the bottom of the
screen the name of the new knight and the number of men-at-arms he commands. 
If you press the trigger button, it will execute the menu option indicated by the position of the crown. 
Thus, if the crown is next to the word "GIFT" and Sir Sremmus is displayed at the bottom of the screen, then
pressing the button will give a gift to Sir Sremmus. 
The SELECT option allows you to choose which knights will accompany you on a campaign into Britain. 
If you select a knight, and then change your mind, you can deselect that knight by pressing the trigger a second
time. 
The color of the knight indicates his state: orange means selected, green means unselected. 
BANISH sends the knight away forever. HONOUR accords military honors to the knight, giving him a larger share of
the men-at-arms in your army. 
If you move the crown to the top of the Round Table Room, you will go to the Throne Room. 
.l1
THRONE ROOM
.p
If you move to the bottom of the Throne Room, you will go to the Round Table Room. 
If you move the joystick sideways, you will change the king under consideration. 
If you press the trigger when the crown is next to an option, that option will be executed. 
The NEWS option allows you to read the international news; one trigger press is required for each news item. 
The message will scroll across the bottom of the display; it will also be symbolized on the map of Britain. 
.p
The PRESTG line executes no action, but displays how much prestige you have. 
The ATTACK option declares war on the king in the bottom text window. 
This must be done before you can pillage an enemy's crops. 
If you change your mind, you can cancel a declaration of war ("Sorry. Never mind.")
by pressing the trigger a second time. 
You cannot attack a king whom somebody else is already attacking. 
His name will not even appear in the bottom text window. 
.p
The TRIBUTE option is the most complex command in the game. 
You begin by placing the crown on the tribute row and choosing the king to whom you wish to offer tribute. 
Then you press the trigger. 
Next you move the joystick sideways to set the amount of tribute you will pay each week. 
Press the trigger a second time to make the offer complete. 
Your tribute payments will continue until you reset the tribute to zero or offer tribute to another king. 
Tribute from another king is shown next to that king's name in the bottom text window. 
.p
If you go to the top of the Throne Room, you will move to the Treasury Room. 
.l1
TREASURY ROOM
.p
If you move the crown down from the bottom of this room, you will go to the Throne Room. 
The option "TITHES" executes no action. 
The left value tells you the amount of tithes you have demanded of your vassals. 
The right value tells you the amount they are actually sending. 
The option "ARMY" controls your army size. 
The left value tells you the amount of money you are spending on men-at-arms. 
The right value tells you the number of men-at-arms in your army. 
You can adjust the left value with the joystick by pushing the joystick right to increase it, and left to
decrease it. 
Press the trigger to make the new value go in. 
The option "TAX" controls your taxes. 
The left value tells you the amount of taxes you have commanded be paid by your subjects. 
You can change this value with your joystick in the same manner that you use with the army. 
The right value tells you the amount of money the people are actually paying you. 
The option "WEALTH" executes no actions. 
The left number tells you how much money is remaining in the kingdom for growth after taxes have been collected. 
The right number tells you the amount of money in your treasure chest. 
The word "EXPERIENCE" at the bottom of the display tells you the amount of experience your men have. 
Moving to the top of the Treasury Room will take you to Merlin's Room. 
.l1
MERLIN'S ROOM
.p
If you move to the bottom of this room, you will go to the Treasury Room. 
If Merlin is present and available to do magic, his face will appear on the right side of the display. 
The brightness of his face indicates his strength. 
For all four options in this room, you may manipulate the joystick sideways to choose the king to whom they
apply. 
The "PLAGUE" option clobbers the king's army. 
The "PESTILENCE" option clobbers the king's crops. 
The "CHANGE" option makes the king like you more, temporarily. 
The SEE option is rather complex. 
When you press the trigger for the SEE option, you suddenly find yourself in the treasury room of the king
whose name was at the bottom of the display. 
You may inspect his finances, but you can change nothing. 
The throne room in the other king's castle differs from your throne room; it has no map of Britain. 
Instead, it shows how the king feels towards each of the other kings. 
Every other king is represented by a small crown. 
The further to the left a crown is, the more the host king dislikes the object king. 
The further to the right, the more he likes him. 
Remember, these are the feelings of the king into whose castle you have gone. 
The foreign round table room shows how many knights the king has at the castle at that moment. 
If the crown is in the table, the king is home. 
If not, the king is gone on campaign. 
To return to Camelot, go up to the equivalent of Merlin's Room, to the SEE option there. 
Press the trigger and you will be back in the true Merlin's Room. 
There is no exit up from Merlin's Room. 
.l1
TRAP ROOM
.p
You cannot choose to go into this room; you are taken there when another king invades Camelot. 
It has a solid red background and the message "KING SO-AND-SO HAS INVADED KING ARTHUR  WILL YOU FIGHT?" 
It displays the total sizes of both armies, counting kings, knights, and men-at-arms. 
You have only two options: to fight or to wait. 
If you wish to fight, press the trigger button and you will go directly into battle. 
If you wish to wait,
push the joystick sideways so that the question reads "WILL YOU WAIT?" 
Then press the trigger. 
Each time that the invader pillages crops, you will be asked the question again. 
You will not be released from the trap room until the invader leaves, either from your victory in battle or
voluntarily. 
.l1
BRITAIN
.p
You enter Britain by moving down from the Round Table Room. 
Whenever you do, any knights whom you have SELECTed will accompany you, along with their men-at-arms. 
You will see a portion of a map of Britain. 
Your crown will be just below the castle of Camelot. 
You may scroll around the map with the joystick. 
The groups of green squares are cropland; the more squares in a cluster, the richer the cropland is. 
There are also the castles of other kings. 
The color of the castle indicates the king's relationship to you. 
A white castle is either Camelot or one of your vassals; you may enter that castle. 
A blue castle is your enemy. 
A red castle is your tributary---the king is paying you tribute. 
A green castle is neutral. 
.p
You may also use Merlin's raven to help you. 
Merlin's raven is available only if Merlin is not fatigued. 
If he is available, you press the trigger button to raise the raven, and then move it with the joystick. 
When it touches the castle it will tell you the name of the castle's king and the number of men-at-arms inside. 
Return the raven to your crown to resume your own motion. 
.p
If you enter a vassal's castle, you will be able to set the vassal's taxes and army in much the same way that
you set your own in the Treasury Room. 
You may also set the tithes that the vassal pays to you. 
If an enemy invades the vassal's domain while you are in the vassal's castle,
you will be taken to the trap room. 
.p
If you have declared war on a king by using the ATTACK option, you may pillage his crops. 
You do this by touching the crops with the jewel of your crown. 
The jewel will disappear and you will stick to the cropland for one week while your men pillage it. 
If the enemy king decides to defend his land, a blue sword will emerge from his castle and approach you.
When it reaches you, the BATTLE scene will begin. 
.l1
BATTLE
.p
When this scene begins, your army is at the bottom of the screen, and your enemy's is at the top. 
The message "PEASANTS KILL N" tells how many invading men-at-arms were killed by defending peasants. 
Press START to begin the battle. 
You move the square cursor with your joystick. 
By placing it onto a knight or king and pressing the trigger, you will be able to read the strength of that
unit. 
If it is one of your men, you will see an "X" which you can move about with the joystick. 
This "X" is the knight's objective. 
When you release the trigger, he will begin moving toward the position marked by the "X". 
If along the way he collides with an enemy, he will attack that enemy. 
If he collides with a friend, he will wait for the friendly knight to move out of the way. 
When knights fight, the attacker is marked with red, and the defender yellow. 
When a knight or king loses heart, his crest is replaced with a checkerboard pattern; if he is friendly, he will
not take your orders. 
When a knight panics and runs, his shield dissolves away. 
The enemy's men may retreat off the top of the screen; Arthur's off the bottom of the screen. 
The battle ends when one king exits the battlefield or dies. 
The initial and final strengths of both victor and defeated are displayed. 
Press START to continue play. 
.l1
GENERAL NOTES
.p
Except during battles, you may save the game by pressing the OPTION key. 
You may pause the game at any time by pressing SELECT. 
Remember that you are always represented by a crown. 
A fanfare means that you had better go read the news. 
If your crown is flashing, it means that an enemy king has set out to pillage your kingdom. 
He will arrive in a short time. 

.BFIRST BATTLES
.l1
Arthur spent the first few weeks settling into Camelot and learning the skills of a king. 
He concentrated especially on meeting with every person at Camelot. 
Many long hours were spent with the knights, listening to their tales and probing their natures. 
.p
He found Sremmus to be an outgoing and warm person, always ready with a laugh. 
Sremmus was a steady and reliable man; most people, sensing this, brought their troubles to him. 
He was not, however, the kind of man whose opinions commanded wide respect. 
Nor was he the greatest of warriors; perhaps his humanity and lust for life prevented him from excelling at the
terrible art of killing. 
Nevertheless, he would certainly perform his battlefield duties with competence. 
.p
Lamerok, on the other hand, was a poor fighter. 
He seemed eager to please Arthur and strove hard for recognition, but he lacked the fortitude of a great knight. 
Arthur could tell that this man would never tap the greatness that lives trapped inside all men. 
Lamerok's great love was for horses. 
He had a number fine animals, and was always looking for more, although
he could ill afford to maintain the ones he already had. 
On the battlefield, Lamerok's gigantic charger would undoubtedly put fear into many an enemy heart. 
If only they knew that the knight riding the mighty steed was not half so imposing as the horse. 
.p
Drofwarc was perhaps the least interesting of the knights. 
He was not a particularly good or bad knight;
other than an uncanny talent for speaking backwards, he had no special interests, virtues, or vices. 
In social gatherings he followed along with everyone else, participating enough to be a member of the group, but
never so much as to make a mark or even be noticeable. 
Drofwarc was a pleasant, bland fellow. 
.p
Lucas was definitely a warrior at heart. 
He stayed on the training field long after all the others had gone to meals. 
An intense fire burned within Lucas, a raging desire to be the mightiest knight on the face of the earth. 
He was very, very good, certainly Arthur's best fighter, and all the men held his skills in high esteem. 
He seemed to care little for the entertainments and pleasures that were available to all the knights,
preferring always to sharpen his martial skills. 
He took immense pride in teaching the other men the martial arts, and especially in leading them. 
Yet he remained a loner, isolated from all other men. 
.p
Arthur found Nosnikta to be the most difficult knight to understand. 
He was very distant, seldom speaking with anybody. 
At meals he ate quietly and left early. 
He never seemed to smile. 
He didn't seem unhappy; Arthur decided that he was a loner through and through. 
He did seem extremely pleased when Arthur presented him with a fine new sword. 
Arthur could not fathom the man's fighting skills, either. 
They seemed adequate without being extraordinary. 
Nosnikta remained an enigma to Arthur. 
.p
Arthur enjoyed the cameraderie with the knights, but Merlin frequently
dragged him off for lectures on economics. 
.i10
.l1
"Why do you insist on boring me with all this nonsense when you can plainly see I have neither interest nor
skill in it?" 
,"It is indeed for both reasons that I lecture you. 
Because you have no skill in the matter, you must learn how to manage your kingdom's wealth. 
Because you have no interest, you must be taught why it is so important." 
,"But is isn't important. 
The people are perfectly happy right now and I have good knights and a good army;
why fidget and fumble with all this nonsense when the kingdom is in such good shape right now?" 
,"Because there is no way of knowing how long matters will remain so pleasant. 
What will you do when a conquering king leads a mighty army into the kingdom and begins to lay waste the land?" 
,"I will lead my army out to destroy him." 
,"Six knights, one king, and six men-at-arms against an army of 50 men-at-arms? 
That's a heroic way to die, surely the stuff of legends, but not very practical." 
,"Then I shall build an army." 
,"With what, young one? 
Twigs? 
It takes gold to hire and train a man-at-arms, one piece of gold every week for his pay, food, squire, horse,
and weapons. 
A mighty army of 50 men-at-arms would cost you 50 pieces of gold every week. 
That is more money than the whole kingdom could supply you with, even if you taxed it to the limit." 
,"Then how am I to get that much gold?" 
,"Perhaps you should study economics!" 
,"Very well, you clever teacher, you have won the joust. 
You may do your worst to me. 
Please begin by telling me how I might raise the money for such an army." 
,"The good king determines the total wealth of his country, and divides it into three portions. 
One portion is set aside for the growth of the realm; it is untaxed. 
In peaceful or secure times, the good king will leave three parts out of four for his kingdom. 
In normal times, perhaps one part of two will go untaxed. 
In dangerous times of war, three parts of four must go to taxes. 
And in extreme emergencies, the good king will take all of the kingdom's wealth for his taxes. 
But remember that there is a difference between the taxes you demand of your people and the taxes they actually
pay. 
If your demand is reasonable, it will be paid. 
But if you demand more than can be paid, you will collect less than you demand." 
.l1
"The other two portions that the king considers go to his treasure chest and to his army. 
Of these, the army is the one you are most immediately concerned with. 
Most of your regular taxes will go to your army. 
One gold piece will pay for the maintenance of one man-at-arms. 
Whatever money you do not spend on the army goes to the treasure chest. 
If all goes well, you will never make use of your treasure chest except to put gold into it. 
Your treasure chest allows you to weather the bad times. 
If you suddenly need a great deal of money, you can take it from the treasure chest. 
The good king insures that the treasure chest has enough gold in it to sustain his army for at least 4 weeks,
6 weeks is better, 8 weeks is very good. "
,"What kind of bad times do you speak of?" 
,"You'll have plenty of opportunity to hear about bad times later. 
For now I want to continue with the subject at hand. 
To summarize: you raise only enough taxes to keep the army going and the treasure chest happy. 
Do you think you understand all that?" 
,"Verily, and quite simple it all is. 
All I need to do is keep the treasure chest full and, when trouble threatens, spend lots of money from it on a
large and powerful army. 
When the battle is over, I disband the army. 
That way I don't need to pay for it every week." 
,"Your thriftiness is exceeded only by your ignorance. 
Do you seriously believe that you can turn a country bumpkin into a man-at-arms by throwing some armor onto his
shoulders and putting a sword into his hand? 
It takes years of training before a man-at-arms becomes an experienced and powerful fighter. 
He can fight from the first day, but he will be only an armored peasant. 
An experienced army would cut down your instant army like a farmer cutting down hay. 
For this reason you must never, never lightly waste even a single man-at-arms. 
Far too much time and training has gone into him to throw his life away lightly. 
Nor can you reduce spending on your army. 
Once you have trained a man-at-arms, it is the height of folly to send him away. 
You must slowly expand your army as your wealth accumulates, never allowing it to shrink." 
.l1
.i0
A trumpet sounded from the throne room. 
.l1
.i10
"It seems you have a message awaiting you. 
Shall we go see what the world has laid at your doorstep?" 
.l1
.i0
Arthur followed Merlin out the door. 
A large crowd had gathered in the throne room to see what event had transpired. 
A messenger waited nervously before the throne itself. 
Arthur stood in the doorway, waiting for the tumult to die down in his presence, then strode to the throne and
seated himself. 
.l1
.i10
"What news bring you, messenger?" 
.l1
.i0
The messenger knelt before Arthur and looked downward, clasping his hands together as if in prayer. 
.l1
.i10
,"O most noble, most exalted King Arthur, wielder of Excalibur, friend of all men, kind and merciful king,
I bring you a message from King Hengist, written in his own hand, in his own words, in which I had no part." 
,"Read the message, messenger." 
.l1
.i0
The messenger looked upward for an instant, his face white as a sheet. 
He fumbled at his bag for a few seconds before pulling out a parchment. 
He unrolled it with trembling fingers, cleared his throat, and started to speak, but only a gutteral croak came
out of his mouth. 
Clearing his throat again, he started to read:
.l1
.i10
"The upstart whelp Arthur has usurped the throne of Camelot with the help of a band of rogues who dare to call
themselves knights. 
I, Hengist, king of Lundenwic, will not tolerate this insult to all royal blood everywhere. 
I will dine in Camelot within a fortnight, and hang the heads of these villeins from the battlements."
.l1
.i0
The silence was broken by a single gasp from somewhere in the room. 
.l1
.i10
"O great and merciful king, look kindly upon this miserable messenger whose bitter task it was to carry this
terrible message. 
Suffer me to go my miserable way in peace." 
.l1
.i0
Arthur did not respond. 
He stared at the wall across the room, frightened and trying to look angry, brave, and nonchalant. 
He was intensely aware that all eyes (save those of the groveling messenger) were focused on him. 
There was nothing to be done here, in front of everybody. 
He would have to discuss it with Merlin. 
He stood up, which act triggered a paroxysm of shuddering and grovelling from the messenger. 
Noticing the messenger's distress, Arthur at last spoke:
.i10
.l1
"Go your way in peace, messenger." 
.l1
.i0
Then, to the assembly:
.l1
.i10
"Let no man fret over this news. 
Hengist and his army are no match for Excalibur. 
I am the rightful king and Excalibur will carry my message to Hengist. 
I go now to rest." 
.l1
.i0
He strode toward the door, followed by Merlin. 
They went to Merlin's room. 
.l1
.i10
"What am I going to do, Merlin? 
Who is this Hengist? 
How big is his army? 
Is he any good? 
Can I beat him?" 
,"Hengist is king of Lundenwic, a kingdom to the east of us. 
He is a hard, fierce man, full of hate, who spends all of his life on the battlefield. 
The only surprise in this is that he chose you from among all of his enemies to attack. 
He is a good general and his army is well-led. 
He can probably beat you." 
.l1
.i0
This was definitely not the answer that Arthur wanted to hear. 
He sank down to the floor and covered his face with his hands. 
.l1
.i10
"We shall all be killed. 
We are all going to die!" 
,"Nonsense. 
You will fight, and you will lose, but you will not die. 
There is always this castle to come home to. 
Hengist can never break the defenses of Camelot. 
You are perfectly safe inside these walls." 
,"Really? 
You mean, there is nothing to worry about?" 
,"There is much to worry about. 
Hengist knows full well that he cannot break into Camelot. 
The only way he can get to you is if you come out to fight him. 
That is why he sent that nasty message: to anger you into fighting him at the first opportunity. 
And if you stay inside Camelot castle, he will surely ravage the land, burning and killing in an effort to
bring you out of the castle. 
If you do not fight him, your land will be ruined and Hengist will take back to Lundenwic the wealth of your
kingdom. 
You must fight him, but at the same time you must not be killed. 
,"And how am I to manage that?" 
,"Ho-ho, do not worry about that. 
Just do what comes naturally." 
.l1
.i0
Arthur did not understand Merlin's advice, but he did not press. 
He had much to do. 
For the next few days, he commissioned four more men-at-arms and worked furiously to
train these green soldiers into effective fighters. 
Merlin tried to dissuade him from this rash course, warning him that raw soldiers were useless, but Arthur would
have none of Merlin's logic. 
With the decision to fight made, he had resolved to fight with the largest army he could raise. 
.l1
A few weeks later, plumes of smoke announced the arrival of Hengist. 
Arthur and Kay stood in the watchtower of the castle, watching the arriving enemy. 
.l1
.i10
"I count 10 knights and 20 men-at-arms", announced Sir Kay. 
"Those are not very good odds for our 6 knights and 10 men-at-arms. 
What say you, Arthur: do we fight or do we wait?" 
,"We have nothing to wait for; we shall fight." 
.l1
.i0
The little army gathered in the courtyard. 
The men mounted their war horses, set their armor straight, and checked their weapons. 
Then, when all were ready, the drawbridge was lowered and out they rode, through the town and out to the field
outside the town. 
.p
There Hengist waited with all his men drawn up in line for battle. 
Unlike Arthur's knights, each of whom had his own distinctive crest, Hengist's knights all bore the crest of
their king on their shields. 
It was an impressive sight, all those knights and men-at-arms lined up and waiting for battle. 
Arthur put all his men into line, organizing them in the sequence he thought best. 
Each knight had one man-at-arms under his leadership; Arthur had two men in his royal guard. 
By contrast, Hengist had four men-at-arms in his royal guard, while most of his knights had two men-at-arms. 
A large crowd of peasants was gathering on Arthur's side of the field. 
They knew the fate that lay in store for them if Arthur were defeated. 
Their homes burned, their cattle stolen, their crops destroyed, they would have little chance of surviving the
coming winter. 
For them, this battle was a life-and-death matter. 
They came armed with clubs and sticks, pitchforks, shovels, whatever they could lay their hands on. 
They meant to fight. 
Neither side acknowledged their presence; they were "residue". 
When Arthur was ready with his army, he raised his arm. 
Hengist raised his arm. 
They both dropped their arms and the two armies began slowly moving towards each other. 
.p
At this moment, the peasants raised a ragged yell and dashed across the open space towards the enemy. 
Reaching them, they began to hack and bash the slowly riding soldiers. 
The enemy knights regarded them with disgust, only bothering to kill the most persistent of the peasants. 
It was the task of the men-at-arms to dispose of the scum, a job they seemed to enjoy. 
An armored man-at-arms, wielding a two-handed broadsword, has little to fear from untrained peasants. 
Each sword-stroke sank home with a satisfying thud, while the peasants' ripostes were mere annoying bangs on
armor-plate. 
But some of Hengist's men-at-arms, perhaps the less  experienced ones, did not find
the slaughter so easy. 
Indeed, they were hard put to
defend themselves. 
Perhaps four or five of them fell to the peasants' blows. 
Ten times that many peasants fell; the rest quickly lost their courage and ran. 
.p
The odds were now a little better. 
Arthur's men looked a little less frightened. 
Slowly the gap between the armies shrank. 
They collided with the clanging of sword against shield. 
Arthur raised Excalibur high and shouted a mighty war cry, but was cut short by a blow to his helmet. 
Somewhat chastened (when a sword hits your helmet it can make an ear-splitting racket), he set to work pounding
on his nearest opponent. 
His opponents smashed back, pounding on Arthur. 
All of this pounding created a horrible din but accomplished very little, armor being quite effective. 
Eventually, of course, someone would get a lucky stroke in and penetrate a weak spot, or perhaps simply crush
a section of armor. 
But that would take a while. 
The real problem would come when men tired and began to lose heart. 
.p
Lamerok was the first to hesitate. 
Arthur, seeing him falter, shouted at him to fight, but already fear was swelling in him. 
He looked wildly about, then suddenly bolted and ran, his man-at-arms following. 
.l1
.i10
"Coward!", Arthur screamed. 
"Come back and fight!" 
.l1
.i0
But Lamerok was gone. 
Too late, Arthur realized that one of his own guard had already been struck down by Hengist himself. 
That left Arthur and one man to fight Hengist and three men. 
Grimly he fought on, but then Sremmus lost a man and bolted. 
At about the same time, Nosnikta lost his nerve and took to his heels. 
All along the fighting line, men were looking around anxiously. 
They could all see the fleeing knights. 
If the odds were bad earlier they were worse now. 
There is no point in fighting when everyone else is running. 
Suddenly, the whole army simply broke up and ran. 
Even Arthur was overwhelmed by the mad panic of the moment; he joined in the scramble to get back to the
castle. 
It was a wild, chaotic rush, a desperate attempt to get to safety regardless of cost. 
Men trampled one another, abandoned their belongings, clawed their way to the castle. 
.l1
When at last they were within the safety of the courtyard, sanity returned. 
Oddly enough, only three men were lost in the entire debacle. 
Arthur's first battle was over. 
He had lost, and the shame of having run, the sadness for the three dead men, and the real loss to his kingdom
weighed heavily on his heart. 
But the dominant emotion he felt was joyous relief, relief that he was alive, relief that he had faced the enemy
and not been annihilated. 
He had expected it to be much more terrible. 
For having lost a battle, he had gotten off lightly. 
.p
But there was time for neither sadness nor rejoicing, for Hengist was continuing to pillage the kingdom. 
Within a week a delegation of peasants was before Arthur, begging that he defend them from the ravages of
Hengist's army, and promising that a sizable contingent of peasants would assemble if only they had Arthur's army
as a rallying point. 
Again Arthur faced the difficult decision, to fight or to wait. 
He had lost three men in the previous battle, but Hengist had lost five. 
The peasants weren't very efficient, but they would surely take a few more of the enemy with them. 
Furthermore, Arthur had already recruited a promising young lad to replace one of the lost three. 
There was no decision to make; Arthur knew he had to fight. 
.p
Once again the men mounted their horses. 
Once again they rode out from the castle. 
This time they had to ride twenty miles to the meadow of Peonnum, where Hengist's army was encamped. 
On arrival, both armies drew up into their battle lines. 
Hengist had ten knights and fifteen men-at-arms; Arthur had six knights and eight men-at-arms. 
As promised, a large and motley collection of peasants converged on the meadow, brandishing a ridiculous array
of implements whose value against an armored knight was mostly acoustic. 
Arthur shook his head sadly; they were going to be massacred. 
But, he consoled himself, at least this way they had a fighting chance. 
If his army weren't there, they would be hunted down and massacred anyway. 
Perhaps this way they could take a few with them. 
.p
Once again the two kings raised their arms, and once again the two lines began to move toward each other. 
Once again the rabble of peasants surged forward. 
It particularly disturbed Arthur to see so many die so pointlessly. 
But, when the last peasant had fled, 
the piles of ragged dead included another four armored bodies. 
.p
Heartened by this beneficial development, Arthur's men began to shout confidently. 
They pressed forward with vigor, and when the two lines collided, there was such a mighty din as was heard all
way to the village on Defereal. 
The men fought hard, and within five minutes several on each side had fallen, including two of Hengist's own
knights. 
.p
But the tide of battle was slowly turning against Arthur's men. 
Even though they gave as good as they got, they had been outnumbered from the start, and their disadvantage
grew with each casualty. 
This time Nosnikta was the first to hesitate. 
Then Drofwarc, who in the surge of battle had been swept far from the main body of Arthur's men, lost heart. 
Exhausted and isolated, he ceased his attack and tried only to defend himself. 
A moment later, Arthur saw him go down under the combined blows of many assailants. 
Then Lucas lost his man-at-arms, and that rattled him. 
He swung his horse around and galloped back in the direction of Camelot. 
That did it. 
Within seconds, the morale of the entire army collapsed. 
Men turned and ran. 
Once again Arthur found himself caught up in the flight. 
This time, however, he was more collected. 
He single-handedly covered their retreat, warding off pursuers. 
Once again they found themselves back inside Camelot, nursing their wounds. 
.p
Again three men-at-arms had been lost. 
His remaining five men included three who had joined in the weeks before Hengist's arrival. 
They were quite green. 
Worse, Arthur had lost one of his knights, Drofwarc the Dull. 
Arthur's little army had been shattered. 
He could again console himself in the good points: Hengist had lost many men and two knights. 
He may have lost the battle but he was satisfied with its outcome. 
He had faced a fierce and terrible opponent and inflicted heavy losses upon him. 
Hengist had no choice now but to return home. 
.p
As Arthur expected, Hengist struck camp and began moving eastward, toward his own kingdom. 
He was thunderstruck when word came that Hengist had pitched camp on the plain at Wodnes Beorg and was sending
out pillage parties who were again ravaging the countryside. 
.l1
.i10
"The man is a fool!", Arthur muttered. 
"He cannot possibly wish to fight again, not after the thrashing I gave him. 
What possesses him that he should behave so perversely?" 
.l1
.i0
There was nothing left to do save fight again. 
Having replaced one of his three losses from the previous battle, Arthur had five knights and six men-at-arms. 
Off they rode in search of Hengist. 
This time, Hengist's army numbered but eight knights and eight men-at-arms. 
A large and very ugly collection of peasants was lurking in the forest next to the plain of Wodnes Beorg. 
The battle began, and they played their role, finishing off six
of the men-at-arms at fearful loss to themselves. 
The outcome of the battle was almost preordained. 
Hengist's men fought for a few moments, but they could see the odds. 
Within a few moments several of them had ceased fighting. 
Within another few moments the whole army was in flight. 
They left behind another two of their comrades in the dust. 
.p
Arthur watched them run, breathing hard from his exertions. 
He did not feel triumph or exultation. 
Somehow the elation of victory was lost on him. 
There had been no doubt in his mind as to the outcome, and so there was no joy when the inevitable came to pass. 
His men, on the other hand, were beside themselves with jubilation. 
Twice before they had been humiliated by this invader, and now they were the victors. 
They galloped about the battlefield, trampling the bodies of the fallen enemy, hoisting his banners high in the
air and taking swipes at them, shouting and laughing. 
Off to the enemy camp they rode, to loot it of its goods. 
The real value of the camp lay in its cattle-pens, where stood the cattle
stolen from farms all over the kingdom. 
A hundred head of cattle were there, and they were now all Arthur's. 
Their peasant-owners were almost surely dead. 
There was nothing to do but take them back to Camelot and sell them. 
His treasury would be a little richer, but the loss in revenues from the pillaged land was far greater. 
.p
On the way back to Camelot, Arthur toured the pillaged areas. 
The destruction was almost total. 
Every building had been burned, every farm implement smashed, evey peasant who had not fled killed. 
The survivors would rebuild, but it would be a long time before this was productive land again. 
Arthur grieved for the loss, and knew he had been right to fight. 
Had he not fought, this tragedy would have been repeated all over the kingdom. 
It was a sad king and a happy army that filed over the drawbridge into Camelot.

SOME COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS

The first round of playtesting generated a great many questions from people who had difficulties with the game. Here are answers to some of the questions asked.

HOW DO I GET BACK TO CAMELOT FROM THE MAP OF BRITAIN?
     All you have to do is touch the castle of Camelot with your crown and you will go into Camelot.  The trick is knowing which castle is Camelot. You could use Merlin's raven to identify the castle. Or you could use the map at the end of the manual to figure out where you are.

HOW DO I GET BACK TO CAMELOT FROM INSIDE ANOTHER KING'S CASTLE? 
     If you used Merlin's magic to get there, just go up to the room that would be Merlin's room and press the trigger button. That will take you back to Camelot. If you were in the castle of one of your vassals, go out the door at the bottom of the screen and into Britain; go from there to Camelot.

ONE OF MY VASSALS IS NO LONGER MY VASSAL. HOW COME? 
     As liege, you are expected to defend each of your vassals against all attackers. If you fail to defend one of your vassals against an attacker, the vassal may well decide to seek another liege who will protect him. 

THE NEWS SURE IS SLOW!
     Every news message has a corresponding representation on the map. If you learn to read this pictorial representation, you will be able to go through the news much faster. 

I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHEN THINGS ARE HAPPENING FROM THE NEWS
     That's one good reason to read the news often---the only way to get a good feeling for the news is to watch it unfold as it's happening. If you go away on campaign and then return to a pile of old news messages, you should expect it to be a little confusing. Ye Liu Chutsai, advisor to Ghengis Khan, said it best: "You can't rule a kingdom from the saddle!" 

HOW MANY NEWS MESSAGES CAN THERE BE IN THE PILE AT ONE TIME?
     About a hundred. If you don't read your news, and the pile of messages gets too large, a fanfare will sound to remind you to go read your news before it gets lost. If you still don't read your news, the oldest messages will be erased to make room for the newer messages. 
THE NEWS MESSAGE "KING X OFFERS TRIBUTE": TO WHOM IS HE OFFERING TRIBUTE?
     To you, Arthur. Remember, though, that a king will stop paying tribute as soon as he is attacked. 

I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ROUND TABLE ROOM
     Each shield stands for a knight. Knights that are standing close to each other are good friends. Knights standing far apart don't like each other. If a knight is close to your crown in the center of the Round Table, then he is loyal to you. If he stands far away from your crown, then he is not very loyal. If a knight is standing directly on top of Queen Gwynevere, then he is VERY good friends with Gwynevere. VERY, VERY, good friends with her. How do you think the rest of the knights will feel about that? What do you think you should do? ("Gimme a B; gimme an A....")

HOW CAN I TELL IF OR WHEN MY KNIGHTS WILL REVOLT?
     If the knights inside Camelot (i.e., alive but not accompanying you on campaign) are disloyal, they will revolt. Don't leave disloyal knights behind without some loyal knights to counterbalance them!

I CAN'T KILL ENEMY KINGS IN BATTLE; THEY ALWAYS ESCAPE!
     If you were losing, would you hang around and get killed?

HOW COME ARTHUR IS SO WEAK ON THE BATTLEFIELD? AFTER ALL, HE HAS EXCALIBUR!
     The best answer to this comes from Merlin in the movie, EXCALIBUR. When Uther Pendragon demanded, "The sword! You promised me the sword!", Merlin replied, "And you shall have it---but to heal, not to hack." Excalibur is NOT a Dark Ages ultimate weapon.

THIS GAME IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN!
     See next question.

THIS GAME IS TOO EASY!
     See previous question.

OK, SO WHAT'S THE SECRET TO WINNING?
     That's easy; it's leadership.
